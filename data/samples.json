[{"PROJECT": "PL-008", "YEAR": 2024, "MONTH": "October", "NAME": "Fundacja Twoja Rola / Manufaktura Sitowie Gardens", "DESCRIPTION": "Twoja Rola Foundation, led by Wojciech \u017bak, developed a 2,000-square-metre urban farm called the Manufacture of the Sitowie Garden. Drawing on the experience and support of the Sitowie Estate project, this initiative integrates urban farming with occupational activation and horticulture therapy for the project's beneficiaries.The primary focus of the farm is cultivating crops such as cucumbers, beetroot, and Chinese cabbage, which serve as the base ingredients for the farm\u2019s organic preserves. The foundation specializes in the production of fermented foods, including beetroot sourdough, pickled cucumbers, kimchi, naturally fermented vegetables, and black garlic. Additionally, the farm offers fresh, seasonal vegetables depending on the harvest, such as tomatoes, green beans, courgettes, kale leaves, and nasturtium flowers and leaves. This case could help us to explore the impact of the urban farm on local food systems, social rehabilitation, and its contribution to promoting sustainable urban agriculture.", "COUNTRY": "Poland", "GEOGRAPHY": "Gdansk", "FILE": "PL-008_interview_audio.m4a.csv", "TYPE": "interview", "RECORD LANG": "pl", "RECORD FILE": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gn2qkZhPG_p4GEAqlFJDTHwn0OEnj5MM", "TRANSCRIPT": "[00:00:00 - 00:00:21] Malgorzata : Also today we are at Sitow in Gdansk, 8 November 2024 and we are talking about Your Role Foundation. Also I'm going to move on to ... Maybe introduce yourself, say a few words about yourself.\n[00:00:21 - 00:02:43] Wojciech \u017bak : My name is Wojciech \u017bak, I represent the Twoja Rola Foundation from Gda\u0144sk. And tell us, yes? Ok, fine. I'm the chairman of the board. Our foundation has members in addition to the chairman of the board, the board has a foundation council. We currently employ, in terms of staffing structure, seven people. Most of them are commissioned people on temporary contracts of about half-time. In this we employ socially included people, our charges, in the number of three, here, four, four, four people. Our foundation was established in 2018 and realistically started in 2019. in three such areas. The first is the area of social welfare, supporting socially excluded people, and mainly just people in crisis of homelessness and people with disabilities. Our second pillar of activity is urban farming, urban gardening and the development of the social economy in the context of processing grown vegetables and creating this concept of pickles, sourdoughs and various other fermented things under the name sow ferment. Our third area is environmental education, the kind of environmental education based on our garden. We invite children from the kindergarten, we tell a story and show them what nature looks like in the city, how beetroots grow from a seed to actually into a vegetable and into a specific preparation. Finally, I would just like to add that our foundation runs flats with support for families in crisis of homelessness and one training flat for an immigrant family and a Roma family.\n[00:02:46 - 00:02:55] Malgorzata : OK, thank you for that. So if you could sum up in one sentence who you are and what you do, what would you call it?\n[00:02:55 - 00:03:12] Wojciech \u017bak : A difficult task. Well, we are sowing ferment. And in fact, in one sentence, we are activating socially included people and developing the social economy in Gdansk, Poland.\n[00:03:15 - 00:03:16] Malgorzata : And with food, that is?\n[00:03:16 - 00:03:42] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, and we are also sort of developing the area of sustainable food, production, sales, and we also want to influence consumer awareness of not wasting food and eating healthily. And the traditional use of local products, too, in line with the idea of farm-to-table and a low carbon footprint, a short one.\n[00:03:44 - 00:03:57] Malgorzata : Great. And now let's try to identify the partners or the audience, who you interact with, who you work with. Let's try to name them.\n[00:03:57 - 00:07:03] Wojciech \u017bak : The whole network. Because we operate multi-district, we work with the local government. We cooperate with the district council. We cooperate with the City Centre for Family Support, which is a local government unit under the Mayor of Gda\u0144sk. We cooperate with other NGOs, which are implementing the Sitowie Estate project, but we are also very often invited to various projects related to green innovations, related to food, but also to activities, with organisations that deal with combining the three sectors, the local government sector, business and NGOs. That is it. Now we have joined such a Polish network of social economy entities, a project called SAMOES. We are kind of one of the members there. So this is our first move to go outside, to join a network of organised organisations with a similar, maybe not structure, but the idea of activities related to the area of Aha, good. So we have kind of this second area. The third area is, well, we work, as it were, with the charges, that is, with the clients of the Municipal Centre for Family Support. This is the whole group of socially excluded people. On the one hand, we support them, but we also activate and employ them. We create these so-called secure jobs for these people. And the third, or fourth, very often in this non-governmental area, NGOs, difficult to cooperate with, is business. And because, in turn, we run a social business, so we must have business partners, so we cooperate with the local delicatessen chain, with individual delicatessens, with products that are healthy, sustainable, but also with premium products. In general, the products we produce are generally aimed at a more affluent customer. In general, the products we produce are intended to be aimed at a more affluent customer, one who is aware of what they eat and can spend a little more than they would normally. In a shop for the same product, but knows that, firstly, it is a social product, secondly, despite the lack of certification, it is naturally produced, it is local, etc.\n[00:07:04 - 00:07:15] Malgorzata : If we can summarise, we have the city, which means it's local government, it's the city with this family support centre and then there's the district council.\n[00:07:15 - 00:07:32] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, speaking of these local communities, it is such a very important body also by virtue of its location and such being in a neighbourhood.\n[00:07:32 - 00:07:41] Malgorzata : Because that's what I wanted to summarise, is it one group of actors, then we have these food recipients, which is business, yes?\n[00:07:41 - 00:08:21] Wojciech \u017bak : And individual customers, as it were, because they actually sell it to shops, and they buy it, as it were, to these end customers, right? So usually residents of the Tricity, We also sell to the catering industry. We started selling to sourdough and cucumbers, for example, for a producer of Okowit, which is a high quality vodka, who has his premises in \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, also in Gda\u0144sk. One that is very exclusive, where potato vodka is bitten into and sipped with our sourdough and our cucumbers.\n[00:08:21 - 00:08:35] Malgorzata : Well, now I wanted to identify this way, let's take these actors one by one. Do you distinguish between this collaboration between the local government, the district council? Then let's start with the local government. What do you give them, the local government?\n[00:08:35 - 00:10:02] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, we perform certain tasks related to this sustainable development, yes? So we are, firstly, activating those who are socially excluded, in other words, helping those in need who are in the social system to become active and independent. We also take care of the environment locally, even though we are in a very industrial district. We educate the whole society, young people and kids. So in this area of sustainable development, we are certainly a good partner, but also as innovators, because I don't think there is such a place in Poland where there are several non-governmental organisations in one street. There is a strictly social project, a strictly housing project within the Gda\u0144sk Social Housing Programme, where we have social activation, professional activation and providing accommodation, and apart from that we have a garden, an urban farm, where we grow vegetables, we process them, we breed green chickens, right, and somewhere in there we kind of take care of and teach these people, we educate them, so related to caring for the environment, for nature, but also for what we eat.\n[00:10:02 - 00:10:03] Malgorzata : And what does self-government give you, this cooperation?\n[00:10:05 - 00:10:41] Wojciech \u017bak : Partly very solid financing, yes, they support us financially, because it's like the whole project, in fact the manufactory and these flats, here these houses on Sitow are commissioned as if on, as part of the cooperation with NGOs and they are developed within the framework of such, this programme and these are commissioned tasks, so they are kind of competition tasks, yes, so the city commissions such a task and NGOs enter the competition and then they receive funds for these activities.\n[00:10:41 - 00:10:43] Malgorzata : And from their perspective, what are you giving them?\n[00:10:45 - 00:14:11] Wojciech \u017bak : What do we give them? Well, just what I said, which is all of that, which means we give them the opportunity to, I don't know, also show off our activities, yes? What do we give them? Well, I guess you could say we also work a little bit with the socially included, that is with people in need of help, so we help them to become independent, the unemployed, the sick, people in crisis of homelessness, we give them that they can, I don't know, we also inform them, yes, in the sense of informing the residents that these activities are in collaboration. just with the city, so that it's kind of subsidised with these city funds, so basically, well, we're giving them also, I don't know, such marketing things, but such informative little bit. We can also just add that the very project of this sitowa estate got two awards in 2013-2014. nationwide, related precisely, we kind of got an award for social innovation, as if within the framework of social services, that is, such deinstitutionalisation. This is important because, as if in general, all such systems coming out of state laws, systemic, related to support for people with disorders, mental illnesses or homelessness. These tasks are usually carried out by NGOs commissioned by the city, because the city does not have such resources and very often such competences, because in fact people who are more experienced or active in the area of support are employed in NGOs, and some NGOs simply specialise in a particular area. And so in Gda\u0144sk, we have such large organisations that deal with people with the problem of homelessness. We have several organisations that also deal with just supporting people and in the area of mental health. Similarly, when it comes to independent children leaving foster care, there used to be institutional children's homes, a total institution of this kind, where there were 50-60 kids, and they were usually some barracks, some very large buildings. and deinstitutionalisation of this, as it were, and various things happened there, but they simply started to create family support homes for these young people and children, where suddenly, how can we say? They just started to live in smaller houses, family houses, you could say. They also have coaches, carers and round-the-clock care, but it's no longer a total institution where 15 people live in one room. And in such a home, for example, there are, I don't know, 8 kids or 12, that's also by word of mouth.\n[00:14:12 - 00:14:15] Malgorzata : Okay, but it's kind of not in your point anymore.\n[00:14:15 - 00:14:16] Wojciech \u017bak : No, no, no.\n[00:14:16 - 00:14:36] Malgorzata : Informative. And now I wanted to, this cooperation with the local government, if we were to put it on a scale of 1 to 3, in terms of the importance of your existence and cooperation and what you do as a foundation, you would give it from 1 to 3 how much?\n[00:14:38 - 00:14:39] Wojciech \u017bak : Three most?\n[00:14:40 - 00:14:43] Malgorzata : One most important, one two three.\n[00:14:43 - 00:14:44] Wojciech \u017bak : Well at the moment it's one, yes.\n[00:14:44 - 00:14:52] Malgorzata : Today do you rate it as positive, negative, neutral?\n[00:14:52 - 00:15:37] Wojciech \u017bak : Neutral, because, as it were, our other part, which, let's say, is already beginning to self-finance itself from our activities, is, one might say, precisely we cannot yet say that we are independent of external funds raised from the local government. So in general, from the experience of running a non-governmental organisation, it is clear that becoming dependent on public funds is never a good thing. There is an area that our organisation has not yet developed, like fundraising, or some kind of fundraising from external, I don't know, sponsors, so-called donors. It's kind of limping along, but because there's not much funding for anything at all.\n[00:15:39 - 00:15:45] Malgorzata : And now the District Council. Is she connected to it or is it a separate actor?\n[00:15:45 - 00:16:17] Wojciech \u017bak : This is a little bit separate. It stems from a certain courtesy, because our activities are in a specific reality, in a specific place, in a specific city. in a specific neighbourhood, and it is a project, I am already speaking in general terms here about Sitow, which also touches upon social, local life. Whole communities, not just our project and people who are in the process of becoming independent, but so-called normal residents.\n[00:16:17 - 00:16:29] Malgorzata : And we are the ones who are going to put the accent, the focus on this food sustainability, in the sense of sustainability. But if I want to ask about the neighbourhood, what do you give them?\n[00:16:29 - 00:16:54] Wojciech \u017bak : What do we give to the district? Well, we get involved in local activities that the neighbourhood council organises, be it some picnics or some festivals. So we kind of get involved there, we co-organise such events. We always have the nicest, most colourful stand with all sorts of things. What else do we give? Well, it's so difficult, you have to ask them.\n[00:16:54 - 00:16:57] Malgorzata : But in your opinion, from their points of view?\n[00:16:57 - 00:17:08] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, I mean I don't know if we more Calm. We'll start more... It's kind of an anecdote, but I'm not going to quote it there anymore. See, he unloaded.\n[00:17:08 - 00:17:09] Malgorzata : No, no, no.\n[00:17:09 - 00:18:06] Wojciech \u017bak : It works. Okay, so generally what else do we give? Well, I don't know what else, apart from the colour we can give here. It's hard to say what. We probably also teach a kind of tolerance towards people who have some other problems, yes? So we're also kind of informing the public again that not only are there good people and those who are doing well in life, but there are also other people, so it's certainly tolerance and diversity, so to speak. What else are we giving? I don't know, it's hard to say what we add, well we rather cooperate, no? It's also not that much of a collaboration, although.... From 1 in 3 it's... Well... I think three, but it's worth pointing out that there's a local body somewhere that you have to live well with too.\n[00:18:07 - 00:18:10] Malgorzata : And they rather positively, neutrally?\n[00:18:10 - 00:19:10] Wojciech \u017bak : Right from the start, very positively. Here, too, as far as the mood was concerned, the very body of these neighbourhood council chairmen and so on were very much in favour. In contrast to the residents, because as the beginning of the project itself, the residents were a little bit confused, maybe a little bit scared. They started to go to the neighbourhood, because here there are two homes for single mothers, runs an organisation. which is primarily associated with drug dependents, namely Monar Markot. But Monar Markot runs, in addition to specialist facilities for people with addictions, homes for homeless people who have nothing to do with drugs. But the name is very associated. And here, by not fully understanding what it was about, residents somewhere came to the district council with such concerns.\n[00:19:11 - 00:19:15] Malgorzata : But that didn't apply to you, there was just this other organisation.\n[00:19:15 - 00:19:15] Wojciech \u017bak : Tak, tak, tak.\n[00:19:15 - 00:19:20] Malgorzata : That is, in general, we can also add residents as such, as a separate actor.\n[00:19:21 - 00:19:23] Wojciech \u017bak : I think so, certainly. Well, yes, yes.\n[00:19:24 - 00:19:26] Malgorzata : And what are you giving these residents?\n[00:19:26 - 00:19:29] Wojciech \u017bak : You excel in traditional foods.\n[00:19:29 - 00:19:30] Malgorzata : I'm more focused on that.\n[00:19:31 - 00:20:15] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, to the inhabitants in the sense of the district or the inhabitants of Gda\u0144sk. Because if it's the inhabitants of Gda\u0144sk or the Tricity, well, we give them a great product, high quality, healthy, in small volumes really, that is also such a premium product. We also give them the opportunity to support jobs for these people. So that's it too. So they also have this sense of some kind of empowerment. What do we give them? A good feeling, a smile. This is what a person can give to another.\n[00:20:15 - 00:20:20] Malgorzata : And now there is a difference between these general residents and neighbourhood residents?\n[00:20:20 - 00:21:30] Wojciech \u017bak : I don't know, because it's basically a small low-rise neighbourhood. It is an industrial district of older people. And in fact there are very few of these relationships. It's an area that is one of the biggest and richest, because it has a refinery, which is the biggest CIT payer in Gda\u0144sk. But this does not translate into the situation of these people. If only because there are very few of them. And it is quite depopulated. So these contacts are also very sporadic. Here the inhabitants know each other. At the time of the pandemic, we supported them somewhere in terms of... We made masks for them. We had products for them from the infection, because the organisations were the first to get somewhere. Everyone was surprised, right, it was the shortages, and we were responding somewhere. Even though we were a small organisation, here with the residents others we came and delivered to the district council just such things.\n[00:21:30 - 00:21:35] Malgorzata : So now those residents on this scale of 1 to 3, would you put where those?\n[00:21:35 - 00:21:40] Wojciech \u017bak : Those local ones we work with, 3.\n[00:21:40 - 00:21:43] Malgorzata : And those from all over Gdansk, that is, those customers, yes?\n[00:21:44 - 00:23:02] Wojciech \u017bak : Well I would like it to be that 2, no? Because we are in 29 shops. We already feel that we are some kind of recognition of this brand. Well it's not yet translating into the kind of sales we would like. No? But we also participate, we were at the St Dominic's Fair this year. We were there almost, for a total of two weeks, or two-thirds of the time, so we also met and always, whether with the locals, well the locals already know us, those who are also in the area of buying such products, let's say, pro-health, probiotic pickles. Well they know us, we're already a well-known brand and they kind of know our history, so that we support it, we work with excluded people, that we run an urban farm and so on, and so on, that we also buy this product from local farmers, so that's cool too. Well that, well that, well that, maybe a two I would even give that actually, but that's also, well we're talking about a city of half a million people, Well we sell radius there, so it's hard to say if we have any greater relationship with the locals.\n[00:23:02 - 00:23:05] Malgorzata : But this is one of the recipients in the system.\n[00:23:05 - 00:23:10] Wojciech \u017bak : Very important, no? We try to put some emphasis on that too.\n[00:23:10 - 00:23:14] Malgorzata : And now these farmers, because we're going to add them too, aren't we? Well, sure, no.\n[00:23:14 - 00:23:27] Wojciech \u017bak : And the supply companies, no? Because we sort of also buy packaging somewhere, well, because here they'll be, I don't know, Everyone somewhere fulfils a role.\n[00:23:27 - 00:23:30] Malgorzata : We have, I don't know... These are the locals.\n[00:23:30 - 00:24:09] Wojciech \u017bak : Are these ... Different, different. Well as far as vegetables are concerned, they usually are, although like you were today, you came from Bioplanet, no? So generally from a company in Leszno. It's the biggest, the biggest shop, let's say, a cult of certified products. It is a joint stock company. And we also cooperate with them, because they have a very wide range. They have a lot of products. Sometimes if we run out of something, we save ourselves by buying from them. But basically, we use certified organic farmers from the area around Gda\u0144sk, so Kashubia, \u017bu\u0142awy.\n[00:24:09 - 00:24:16] Malgorzata : That is, you exploit the product. I mean the product, the vegetable. And what do they gain from this exchange too?\n[00:24:17 - 00:24:27] Wojciech \u017bak : I don't know. Actually, one and the other also do the same thing we do, which is preserves. But they sell the goods to us. I don't know, they just make money on us.\n[00:24:27 - 00:24:29] Malgorzata : And this relationship would be 1-3?\n[00:24:31 - 00:24:44] Wojciech \u017bak : Well it's one, I think, because we practically order them once, twice a month, so it's kind of a relationship. Well, you know, we are always negotiating prices for ourselves.\n[00:24:45 - 00:24:54] Malgorzata : So now, because they were farmers, but you say they are part of this business group, who else is going to be in the business group apart from the farmers?\n[00:24:54 - 00:26:17] Wojciech \u017bak : The way I understand it is that if I do a financial transaction with someone, it's kind of part of our business. Partner. Partner, well exactly. If the company from which we buy bottles or jars, well, that's also Like I said yesterday. it's like these partners also trust us so much that we have some terms already, because we have some turnover with this shop, let's say, so, all of a sudden we become such a full-fledged client or business partner, no? So that's it, well there's a lot of these printers, we also use a local one, a car when the company car breaks down, it's the same from a local mechanic, right? So it's like there's a whole network of just ordinary, dependent partners, where we kind of lose time on each one, in inverted commas, right? Because you have to go to the mechanic, you have to come back, you have to order these nuts, you have to go somewhere, right? We have a food wholesaler where we buy special salt, which is kind of essential in our recipes, no? But we try to do everything as little as possible, here just somewhere local on these ludniks or lubka to sort it out, no?\n[00:26:18 - 00:26:22] Malgorzata : So in summary, they are getting orders from you?\n[00:26:22 - 00:26:30] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, well they sort of, yes, they get orders, well they sort of perform a service or sell us some product, no?\n[00:26:31 - 00:26:32] Malgorzata : And what do they get?\n[00:26:32 - 00:26:47] Wojciech \u017bak : What do they get? They get cash, they earn their margin. You would have to ask what else they get. As I say, from us, always a smile and a hassle-free approach.\n[00:26:47 - 00:26:48] Malgorzata : And they are in that 1-3?\n[00:26:49 - 00:27:16] Wojciech \u017bak : These suppliers are the most important, because if a mechanic breaks out, there's a problem. he drives around with the goods, he does a lot of stuff, so it's those kind of.... It's called operations, no? In running businesses like that and so on. Kito are operational activities, because if one of them doesn't work, well that operation won't be there, so he sort of gives a one.\n[00:27:18 - 00:27:25] Malgorzata : Even now you were talking about these local delis and all these shops where you sell.\n[00:27:25 - 00:27:25] Wojciech \u017bak : Branch.\n[00:27:25 - 00:27:30] Malgorzata : It's also like how do you describe this relationship? Or what do they get from you, what do you get from them?\n[00:27:30 - 00:30:57] Wojciech \u017bak : Oh, one. You could write a book about it here. Well we, yes, so we are in a total of about 29 shops at the moment. We're also in an online shop. It's a world that we want to develop, and we want to develop social media and all this marketing information. I mean, to put it bluntly, without them we wouldn't exist, right? Because they, as it were, mainly sales, individual sales, we have occasional sales, that is, a little bit through our limping or just starting up online shop, through participation in various events, fairs, one-offs. We don't regularly stand somewhere in some green renee in Przymorze, or in, I don't know, the market in Oliwa, or somewhere with our own lines, every week, as if the locals know us, as if, so locally, so we don't. We are at, I don't know, creative fairs. We're at, I don't know, the makers' fair, the so-called climate in the garrison in Wrzeszcz, so, well, there, sort of, the inhabitants of the Tricity, the voivodeship, come, who, well, somewhere there, well, that, well, because they want some of that typical, slightly source product. so, the lady there buys a coat for 2000 zlotys, and she's got a net of fermented hay, where she's got pickles and sauerkraut, no? So it's like this one is a bit of a cognitive dissonance, but it all sticks together, I think. So like this individual sales, it looks so different and it's definitely not the main source of our revenue. The main source of our income and these relations are all kinds of shops, shops, and we are in two local chains, supermarkets, you could say, they are not mega-sized, but they are very often above, I don't know, 150-200 metres, yes, because that's the chain of Merkus shops and the chain of Maxx Xavier shops, with which we are starting somewhere. Apart from that, there are all sorts of local shops that pay attention to what they sell, and usually these are high quality products, and you know that the prices are also a bit higher, so it's a kind of positioning of these customers, it kind of matches our positioning, so it's like we're getting along nicely here. Apart from that, we also cooperate with catering. Yesterday we did our first unite with a catering film. For which we have prepared such a start-up, we'll see how it goes market-wise, mice just from sourdough. There will be an opportunity to buy there. I mean, this amount of money will get gratis now just to sow there. so these are local shops, local chain.\n[00:30:57 - 00:31:05] Malgorzata : So here we have all these entities, shall we say, selling, no? Yes. It's like their on a scale of 1 to 3?\n[00:31:05 - 00:31:05] Wojciech \u017bak : 1.\n[00:31:05 - 00:31:08] Malgorzata : And this relationship is more neutral, positive, negative?\n[00:31:10 - 00:32:45] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, and here, too, we can sort of divide it into positive, neutral and neutral, because the negative ones we don't have yet. Well it's also kind of about issues, yes, the first one is communication. Sometimes there is, from our side we kind of give, we make a blunder, well because we very often have a small team for such commercial activities. We're learning that too. And we also don't bring in topics, sometimes just with delivery. In a sense, where they inform us individually, we come. We text, email or telephone. Mr Wojtek, or whoever, please bring them, because there are none. I also employ people who sometimes don't come to work or are on long-term sick leave. Then there's also a situation where the whole machine, the chain that runs, one screw falls off. Right? In this machine and then, unfortunately, I am still the person who sort of puts out the fire, right? So then I can't do as much, I don't know, deliver as much as the person who should normally do, because I have a thousand other duties connected with, I don't know, other projects, with management, with purchases, because I also have to provide the gentlemen in the garden with what they need, if something breaks, yes?\n[00:32:47 - 00:32:51] Malgorzata : And so, in a nutshell, what do they get from you from the shops? Goods?\n[00:32:51 - 00:34:27] Wojciech \u017bak : Very good stuff. They can also promote what's called corporate social responsibility, which means they let representatives of the social economy onto their shelves, which means they can also tell the customer that this is what they support, but they also encourage the residents or there customers to do that. So that kind of good PR for sure, what they have. They have a good local product, which basically is often in demand, because there are a few people who can point out to the lady manager that there is no sourdough of ours and they can't get us. So there are also those... For example, there are also institutions that sometimes we had some employee volunteering, sometimes we still cooperated with the Gda\u0144sk Development Agency, because it's such a city company, but they also supported us financially. And in turn we also did some employee volunteering for them and so on. And they, for example, invested a little bit in our activities, and they also supported us, but they also did employee volunteering and so on, and they used that later as if in their ESG reports, right? So it's like we're also giving an opportunity to the business, the bigger one, which will soon be involved in the type of reporting they do, that they can sort of join in some initiative, help out, right, and they can later show that in their company documents.\n[00:34:30 - 00:34:39] Malgorzata : And also tell me, because you talked about all these NGOs. And what does that cooperation look like here?\n[00:34:39 - 00:35:35] Wojciech \u017bak : Basically, yes. I'm already very comfortable in that world. Collaboration varies, because I'm not like companies compete a bit with each other, so it kind of varies. Depending on who's there with whom for longer, right, so it kind of varies. As far as this place is concerned, I think the cooperation is basically very good. You have to hire people from different NGOs, they have different bosses, different presidents, they do different things, but we can sort of sit here at meetings and talk about different problems and solve some problems and work together, so basically I would rate it highly, right?\n[00:35:35 - 00:35:37] Malgorzata : And what do you give to NGOs?\n[00:35:37 - 00:36:35] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, what do we give? We as our subject, yes? Well, just the fact that I mainly employ people who are wards of these organisations. So, let's say an organisation ran a home here, a training home. We don't have here, we don't run a training home just on stories, but I use these resources. human resources to employ them, no? So they here themselves, for example, I can ask someone to come a little bit first as part of such a volunteer training, to get involved here. If they show willingness and learn a bit, well, there's a very good chance that we'll employ them at the foundation and they'll be here if they want to, of course, because not everyone likes to, I don't know, work in the garden or peel beetroot, but or the kitchen in general, so we sort of employ them, sort of, people.\n[00:36:35 - 00:36:37] Malgorzata : And what do they give you, NGOs?\n[00:36:37 - 00:38:08] Wojciech \u017bak : They give us? Well, yes, well, access to human resources that we can employ, yes, that's what other NGOs certainly give us. There are NGOs which organise these so-called re-granting events, or organise some kind of conference to which we can go, we can present our products, for example, or, I don't know, meet some interesting people. There's also something like that, now it's going to be the 13th Development Initiation Forum on Tuesday at the Kurta Wodna in Gda\u0144sk, and that's where business, local government and NGOs meet. And it's all about meeting, networking, talking, starting new collaborations. In fact, even before the foundation, I mean before the sieve gardens, it was through such a meeting, through such a forum that I met a girl who was a representative of a very large corporation. We were sitting next to some kind of cooperation, she was interested in the project, she was going to allocate some funds, so it's as if organisations give us some kind of opportunity to broaden these contacts, surely, no?\n[00:38:08 - 00:38:10] Malgorzata : And from one to three organisations?\n[00:38:10 - 00:39:19] Wojciech \u017bak : Well one, one, it's a close one, no? I'm not talking about one organisation, I'm talking about different ones, because there are different organisations, they do different things, and we are basically, yes, we are quite close, although we are a bit of a vanguard, because on the one hand we support ourselves with city funds somewhere, and on the other hand we don't use such EU support, which could help us, in inverted commas, to develop, but they are bureaucratically burdensome for us and are explained by a really big financial risk, so we don't take such a big risk on ourselves, we do it in a balanced and responsible way and we don't throw ourselves in at the deep end either, no, because, well, in a way, due to the fact that the management board is responsible for the foundation's activity, yes, for the whole, as it were, cash flow, yes, we have some people employed, we have to pay social security, pay taxes and so on, and so forth, no.\n[00:39:20 - 00:39:28] Malgorzata : And also, just to come back to these actors of ours, because here you were just talking about all these social media as well, so do you have such partners as well?\n[00:39:28 - 00:39:46] Wojciech \u017bak : Are the recipients maybe? It could be yes, because in terms of partners.... of this socialmedia system, in the sense that we have accounts on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn.\n[00:39:46 - 00:39:48] Malgorzata : But don't you have some influencers, for example?\n[00:39:48 - 00:40:01] Wojciech \u017bak : No, not yet, not yet. But we are thinking about it all the time. There are a lot of ideas that are stupid, or less stupid. But no, this is not the moment yet.\n[00:40:01 - 00:40:03] Malgorzata : That is, the recipients of your comments.\n[00:40:03 - 00:40:34] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, we have some there... Well it's not there because it's hundreds of people. A steady group of people somewhere out there are licking, right? Some stuff. Well, they're also our kind of... But it's also an area we need to improve, because we also do it on a voluntary basis. It looks professional, but when it comes to the schedule of such things, publishing posts, responding immediately, it's still a bit lame.\n[00:40:35 - 00:40:38] Malgorzata : And now these recipients, what do they get?\n[00:40:39 - 00:41:06] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, gee, well, what do they get? Content, content, I don't know what they receive. Well, because we don't do any educational activities there either, it's more of information, so they get information from us, for example, what we do. and where to buy our products. And what do they receive? I don't know. I mean, they like information about our activities, so they get knowledge.\n[00:41:06 - 00:41:10] Malgorzata : And these social media are from 1 to 3?\n[00:41:10 - 00:41:44] Wojciech \u017bak : I think also 1, because not a day goes by that I don't check something, not a day goes by that I don't pass it on to a volunteer, namely my wife, privately, gee, when this post is going to be about this or that, or I send photos, well it's like it's difficult sometimes to have a family life and a work life. It's like a plus, because, you know, running an NGO is like a business, so practically it's not 8 hours a day, it's like 24 hours a day, right? You think about it, don't you?\n[00:41:45 - 00:41:56] Malgorzata : I still wanted to ask about this group. You said that people in need who also participate in this scheme, you would say who these people are, what they receive from you.\n[00:41:56 - 00:42:53] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, yes. That's one of the two main bones of what we do. On the one hand, it's about education, it's about teaching these customers of ours and the people of Gda\u0144sk in general about sustainable food, about the fact that you can also grow this food yourself on your balcony, anywhere, right. You can reduce food consumption, you can, I don't know, not waste food, you can teach it, because it's also like fermentation is a method of preservation and storage and so on and so forth. So that's what we have, and well, people are our second area, it's activity in the area of this kind of social and professional support for these people, so it's like they're the key, because that's one of the five goals of our foundation, this social and professional activation of these people.\n[00:42:53 - 00:42:55] Malgorzata : And they will be in that 1-3.\n[00:42:56 - 00:44:33] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, that's 1. If we are working with someone, with such a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, we try to make sure that he is also involved in the promotion. Today we have just invited Mr Filip to show something more there. Or in our business contacts we try, although we will be outside today, to make sure that these are also our charges. So we try to let them out as well. It's also such an education, a little bit economic, a little bit of going out, well there are people, yes, well it's also important with which people, no? What kind of diseases and conditions they have. We have mental disorders on the one hand, we have mental illnesses on the other hand, so we have people with schizophrenia, with depression, with people, sort of, with these bipolar disorders. or with intellectual disabilities. So it's a whole range of different cases, different stories. Each story has to be approached individually. What else do we have? Well, we also have people in crisis of homelessness, and that's a different group of people we work with with different problems, but if you ask me which group has more problems, you can't really say which one. It's just that each one has different ones.\n[00:44:33 - 00:44:34] Malgorzata : And you give them what?\n[00:44:35 - 00:46:28] Wojciech \u017bak : What are we giving them? Well, first of all, yes. We provide secure jobs. We give them the opportunity to test themselves. We give them the opportunity for some training. We give them the opportunity to improve their livelihood by, I don't know, by providing, as it were, insurance and a normal legal contract. Nowadays even a contract of mandate protects the employee. We don't report them for something sick if they are big. We certainly also give them a sense of security. We also give them a sense of security, as if we were running a social business, so to speak, and we know in the back of our minds that these people very often follow a sinusoidal path, yes? So sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. And in these more critical situations, well, it happens that these people have a bad feeling and don't want to come to work. On the other hand, mothers are very often late or have to take time off work because they have to pick up a crying child from kindergarten, from school and so on. This also disorganises our work a bit, but quite often medical calls taken too. But this is not a reason to be offended at these people, it's just that we have to give a bit more of ourselves and be quite understanding and, I don't know, as an employer I can't be offended or annoyed that there is such a situation, because this is the type of activity which supports these people, because we know that something is going wrong there. Well, in normal life, something falls apart for everyone too, so it's not like it's...\n[00:46:29 - 00:46:32] Malgorzata : Well, and these people in one to three.\n[00:46:32 - 00:46:34] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, one, one, one, so, so.\n[00:46:34 - 00:46:36] Malgorzata : And positively, negatively, neutrally.\n[00:46:36 - 00:47:20] Wojciech \u017bak : Neutrally, neutrally, because on the one hand it's sort of neutral, well, because it's It's a very difficult job, it's a job of basics. It's very often such excessive work, in the sense that you have to repeat and make sure that some employees are doing the correct duties. So it's this. It's basic to have good management, that is also to have the right person with the right qualifications or time capabilities also simply to work with these people.\n[00:47:23 - 00:47:35] Malgorzata : And so, to summarise, these people come to you through either NGOs or the city, that is, this social assistance, or they can also come directly?\n[00:47:35 - 00:48:08] Wojciech \u017bak : Directly, yes. But we're a small sort of entity. And we rather don't, I don't know, no, no, we don't do job advertisements, no? Rather, it's just from these NGO resources, but they're very strongly linked, as it were, to this Municipal Family Welfare Centre in Gda\u0144sk, because they're usually also clients of the Municipal Family Welfare Centre, so they benefit from other systemic support, no?\n[00:48:08 - 00:48:13] Malgorzata : So this Municipal Assistance Centre is something completely different from local government?\n[00:48:13 - 00:49:23] Wojciech \u017bak : I mean no, it's a subordinate unit, it's a separate institution which has its own directorate, but it's under the local government, under the city, no? Under the Mayor of Gda\u0144sk, no? But I can tell you a story, I am pleased with myself, yes, a small digression, about the recruitment process of Maryna, a person as if from outside the Siedle-Sitowy project. Well, this is where we sort of reorganised that my in-house production manager from the processing plant, so to speak, wanted her to step up and change her role a little bit in our organisation or in our workplace, and we transferred her precisely to commercial and sales activities and the distribution of goods, as it were. So she got a bit more freedom, she got a car and so on and so forth. a greater influence on the sale of our products in these shop chains. And I started to recruit by word of mouth the person who had just come from the war. And I just sort of...\n[00:49:23 - 00:49:25] Malgorzata : Shall we add that from Ukraine?\n[00:49:25 - 00:50:11] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, yes, yes. I sort of made it up to myself because it was something I wasn't obliged to do. It was sort of an idea. Well, and through just one of the shops called Charity Shop I left a business card and said what I was looking for, that I was looking for a person to do kitchen work with some experience, also sort of just to manage another lady who is, let's say, less independent. So like that's quite relevant. So I just had, as it were, without an advert somewhere, four recruitment interviews. And I got lucky. I don't want to jinx it.\n[00:50:13 - 00:50:17] Malgorzata : Ok, then I think we have identified all the actors here. Still possibly how ...\n[00:50:18 - 00:50:55] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, that's what they can still be.... Workshops with students? I mean education, I mean kindergartens, schools, where we could possibly work with them here, or we wanted to. I mean more often we have co-operated, we have rebuilt those for them. And yet... There are also various, I don't know, competitions, I mean, competitions, yes, for some projects, right? And sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, but well, maybe it's...\n[00:50:55 - 00:50:59] Malgorzata : And then these are competitions addressed to whom?\n[00:50:59 - 00:51:12] Wojciech \u017bak : In the sense that they are announced by various institutions or companies. And we apply, we write an application and here we want to win some, get money for some activities.\n[00:51:13 - 00:51:16] Malgorzata : And these are private, public?\n[00:51:16 - 00:51:35] Wojciech \u017bak : On the one hand it could be public money, central say, yes? So, for example, the National Liberty Institute prepared us to write a project for our development. Very hard to get, to win. It's tantamount to almost, well maybe it's not alot, no, but.\n[00:51:35 - 00:51:38] Malgorzata : But this is state aid then, already at state level?\n[00:51:38 - 00:52:38] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, central. Or you can also write proposals. A lot of organisations, companies or corporate foundations announce various competitions in this way. And we, for example, have also received funds from the Gda\u0144sk Foundation for Economic Development for educational activities, to support us. So these are also our actors. And it is one of my free partners in general, because it is such an institution which attracts business to Gda\u0144sk and sells investment areas so that Gda\u0144sk can develop, so that as many taxes as possible go to the city coffers. And we are their partner from Stockholm, where we were. Well, it's a building that belongs to the municipality of Gda\u0144sk through a company that aims to sell the land around it, which is still empty, in order to attract business there.\n[00:52:38 - 00:52:39] Malgorzata : And these competitions in 1-3 will be?\n[00:52:42 - 00:52:43] Wojciech \u017bak : Two, two.\n[00:52:44 - 00:53:11] Malgorzata : Right. Okay, let's move on now already.... And now we're going to move on more to understand who you guys are, what you do. That's already a detail. I wanted you to talk about what you guys do, but in general what your history is, how it started and what exactly you do. We are not going to emphasise food.\n[00:53:13 - 00:53:27] Wojciech \u017bak : Okay, so as I mentioned, in 2018 we set up and in 2019 we started to create a garden on the Gdansk Ore Mountains.\n[00:53:27 - 00:53:30] Malgorzata : These Gda\u00f1sk Ore Mountains are a neighbourhood today?\n[00:53:30 - 00:54:04] Wojciech \u017bak : Is this a place? I think it's a settlement simply, which means it's part of Gdansk, no? The part of Gdansk, as I said with the largest area, with the smallest population. It's mainly an industrial district, with low residential buildings. And rather the areas here, although this is changing a bit, because it is very well located, because it is near the centre of Gda\u0144sk, but also near the port of Gda\u0144sk and such important places here... Strategic.\n[00:54:04 - 00:54:05] Malgorzata : Logistically.\n[00:54:05 - 00:56:57] Wojciech \u017bak : Logistically, yes, yes, yes. So that's it. And sort of... Longer story, maybe without details, but basically I was still working here as a project coordinator on behalf of just the City Family Welfare Centre, and basically we saw that there is social activation, professional activation. There are flats, soldiers live here, but we also saw, I just had this moment of fascination with gardens and garlic in general. And there were orchards here, too, because before that, in Rudniki, there were fields, there were pastures and arable land, because basically, here we have the beginning of \u017bu\u0142awy Gda\u0144skie, and this land is of high quality. There are good quality chernozem or beginnings. I knew from the beginning that this land had some potential. Despite the fact that we have a road, a highway, a railway and a refinery, the local people also grow vegetables and fruit all the time at home gardens. they live, no? So I sort of had that... Anyway, I basically privately had a garden today by the airport in Arembichov and I've been eating vegetables all my life from there, because here I sort of got into gardening a bit amateurishly after work and I didn't grow a third hand, no? So that's kind of it. And so using this potential just logistically that we have here and such a territorial potential that there's a piece of land here that was off the mountains, no? There was such a weedy, bushy area here. There was another building that was later demolished. So basically we surveyed the land there. We had tests for heavy metals, but also for the components that are in the soil. And it turned out that the soil was free of any contaminants, of these heavy metals and various other things. It's like there's nothing there at the end of it, but it's rich in the right stuff, isn't it? So basically this plan came up in my head somewhere. And then we sort of set up an NGO, which we started to develop as part of this cooperation programme. But we also saw that it was going to be an element of hortitherapy, that is, we were going to involve these residents of the Siedlesit project to help with the garden.\n[00:56:58 - 00:57:01] Malgorzata : All in a word. What is this Sitowie Estate?\n[00:57:02 - 00:59:20] Wojciech \u017bak : The Sitowie Housing Estate is a city project. It is such a platform of comprehensive support for socially excluded people, who live in one street in Gda\u0144sk, in training houses. where, under the supervision of specialists, a psychologist, a vocational counsellor, a social worker, a professional counsellor, a therapist and trainers, they are in the process of becoming independent. So they came here, they live here and these are people very often from areas, with a problem of homelessness too, yes? Or with a problem I mean, maybe not a problem, but basically from family backgrounds, where, for example, the parents have a person with a disability who is sick, who is, as it were, terminally ill, and they want this child, within the framework of such a flat for two years in this project, to learn some basic activities, such as how to cook, how to do the laundry, in other words, such basic activities that, let's say, a normal person should do. Because generally in such homes, where there is a child with a disability, the parents are very overprotective and very often do everything for the children, even when they are already adults, but they are not independent, because the mother wants to reward them a little, and help herself somehow, so generally also in such homes. We have organisations that deal with just in three homes, there are.... in four, sorry. we have either single women with children and there are NGOs working with these people. This is the care and rehabilitation association Prometheus.\n[00:59:24 - 00:59:29] Malgorzata : Because I understand that, just what you were telling me today, these people are working in your garden?\n[00:59:29 - 01:00:53] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes. They have a contract where they commit to different things. It's kind of a three-way contract. they have to commit a couple of hours a month to either get involved in the garden or get involved in looking after the green hens that we have. Also in the picture. Exactly. So it's more or less like that. And we, by design, first of all thought that it would also be a therapeutic activity, that it would help. And partly it does, because Mr Filip, for example, is such a prime example of this, that working in the garden helps him simply for his mental health and for his comfort and well-being, let's say. And part of it is not necessarily. Working in the garden while producing food in general is quite demanding. It is, let's not hide it, also physical work.\n[01:00:54 - 01:00:58] Malgorzata : That is, it is the garden and this land as an idea first that you cultivate.\n[01:00:58 - 01:03:28] Wojciech \u017bak : And for two years the first one. But it's as if the aim was to create a social enterprise, so that what we grow, the residents can take some of it home and make meals out of it or just eat it. And we will sell the surplus produce to local shops. And so that we will also be at, let's say, markets. And in general, we operated in this way for two years, but the economic return was practically non-existent. And if it hadn't been for the financial support of the city for our activities, payments, etc., the project would have generally collapsed. Because we also have a garden here of about 3,000 metres. We had two greenhouses which were very small and at that time we didn't yet have tunnel crops, which basically help us to increase our yields. Because we are, however, in a temperate climate, so we actually have one this horticultural season. And what we sow in the spring we harvest, but that's more or less how it goes. Well, and after two years, that is in 2021, we decided that we were downsizing, because we had multi-species crops. We had practically such biodiversity. And also I may have forgotten about this closed dressing, that our crops are sustainable crops, we use chemicals, mineral, high, I mean not high, synthetic fertilisers or plant protection centres. We only use the resources we have in our environment. Not exactly, but yes. That is to say, we have a bit of a permaculture cycle, because we have gelding hens that give away their guano, which we compost, or even crustacean bedding. It's a very strong nitrogen fertiliser, so it has to be composted. We use the compost that we have from our operations here, well we just make what we call slurry. So we use this, in inverted commas, enclosed facility and we just grow crops in a sustainable way.\n[01:03:29 - 01:03:30] Malgorzata : What do you grow?\n[01:03:30 - 01:05:31] Wojciech \u017bak : And what do we grow? Well, yes, we started by growing lots of vegetables. Starting with cucumber, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, pumpkins, courgettes, kale, spinach, Chinese cabbage, carrots, leek, parsley and so on. That's what we had for the first two years. And it grew very beautifully for us, because it was fallow land, so nothing had been sown there before, so it must have worked. We were pinching the soil a bit, because we were fighting a bit of weed. But it was just later that the beetroot.... And then after those two years, when we decided that it was, as it were, too much work for us and we didn't fully embrace everything, because we also didn't have enough time, but also not enough, as if economically it didn't make any sense at all, well, we decided that we would reduce the amount of cultivation. On such vegetables, which we will later use for our preserves. And so we went from 15-20 vegetables to six, which we started growing. And we are just using them in our preserves. We're mainly talking about beetroot, which we use to make beetroot leek. We're talking about garlic, which we process into black garlic. Zotkiew, which we make with ginger, chilli and shoyu. Kimchi, which is a traditional Korean pickled dish. Pickled cucumbers. And I think that's it, that would be these six such staple foods. And recently we've been doing kombucha in two flavours, but it's kind of, well there's no connection other than the water here locally, because it's green tea from China.\n[01:05:31 - 01:05:34] Malgorzata : And why are you doing it?\n[01:05:34 - 01:06:02] Wojciech \u017bak : Why? Because, first of all, we like this drink. It's basically very tasty and healthy. Well, and it's quite easy to make. I lied that it's easy to make, but we thought it was a cool product that we could add to our holiday range, that it quenches thirst, it's healthy and markup-wise it could be good, margin-wise too.\n[01:06:02 - 01:06:09] Malgorzata : And tell me, today your income is mostly coming from where? Main source.\n[01:06:09 - 01:07:12] Wojciech \u017bak : From sales. This is difficult to say. Equals sign. From grants and from sales. I would put a bit of an equals sign. Well, as I look at the budget, basically this subsidy side, as I said at the beginning, when you ask about funding, how we look at it, whether it's neutral, whether it's good or bad, it's on a par. And so we're really at such a watershed stage. We'll see which way it goes. Because however, for these four years, five years in total, from 2019 onwards, we have worked very hard for five years. And so far we are at zero. And this is where this moment is very crucial, no? Also, in two years' time we will either launch and you will come and there will be a factory here small, so local. Also. Or we will be gone, no? Because that's more or less what it could look like.\n[01:07:13 - 01:07:19] Malgorzata : And tell me, what is the most expensive for you? What costs the most? Your main expenses where do they go?\n[01:07:19 - 01:07:43] Wojciech \u017bak : Remuneration. This is. Salaries and all those expenses related to operations, that is packaging. Because the products themselves, on the one hand, well that translates, because some of the guys get paid to get something to grow there, right? But those are wages, the cost of the products and the cost of the packaging, no?\n[01:07:43 - 01:07:45] Malgorzata : Okay. And tell me more... So...\n[01:07:45 - 01:07:47] Wojciech \u017bak : And. And electricity. Electricity. Energy.\n[01:07:50 - 01:07:55] Malgorzata : Okay. And tell me, well because you told me about the whole process, how it was step by step.\n[01:07:55 - 01:07:57] Wojciech \u017bak : Tak. No, no, no.\n[01:07:57 - 01:07:59] Malgorzata : Tell me more, what is this black garlic?\n[01:07:59 - 01:09:42] Wojciech \u017bak : Black garlic. Black garlic. And why do you make it? Because it's quite original, it's not very well known, but it's also very healthy. So basically, yes, black garlic is such ordinary, natural garlic that undergoes a fermentation process, but not wild fermentation, not closed fermentation, not open fermentation, not lactic or acetic acid fermentation. It is only subjected to the process of so-called ageing in a special device, where three days must be fulfilled, i.e. a certain time, a certain humidity and a certain temperature. When this is fulfilled within the right parameters, then this kind of black garlic comes out. So that's it. Well, and it is a nutraceutical, which means it is a food product on the one hand, and on the other hand it is a medicinal product. Garlic is said to be a natural antibiotic, because it has pledged aline, allicin, bactericidal and fungicidal things. virucidal too maybe, although virus is rather not in it, but so it's sort of a natural antibiotic. Normally we've done research, but somewhere other producers are bragging about their research results, and it actually comes out that these properties after this fermentation process this black garlic has, let's say, ten times stronger. Our customers also report improved blood results after drinking zachwas. There are also such cases in men.\n[01:09:42 - 01:09:46] Malgorzata : Sourdough is just our regional one? Is it Polish?\n[01:09:46 - 01:10:26] Wojciech \u017bak : Does this exist in today's? It is... I mean yes, certainly the Czechs don't know and the Lithuanians don't know either. Although, in general, sourdough is known in various areas. We even had such customers at the fair, already in the evening, Czech women. They were a bit cheerful and we always conducted tastings and I tasted one. What is it anyway? And they bought probably three bottles and took them to the Czech Republic.\n[01:10:28 - 01:10:33] Malgorzata : Wow, that is so ... I apologise to you because you were talking about those blood results.\n[01:10:33 - 01:11:29] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, yes. And then we have, it's like a product also typically strengthening, improving for example sourdough, but also black garlic. These properties such general human, yes? The circulatory system, the immune system. That's right, the elderly, for example. We also know from our customers that, for example, grandmothers, so-called grandmothers, well, it's like suddenly, gosh, they get a second kick, because suddenly all their blood results, all their parameters improve. They are more energetic, more vital. Well, even Agata Bachusz told me, I didn't know, well put beetroot sourdough on the only legal doping. What does it turn out? It turns out that in the area of marathons, triathlon runs and so on, they just drink sourdough to strengthen the circulatory system, to oxygenate the blood.\n[01:11:30 - 01:11:36] Malgorzata : It has an amazing... These are so local... Yes, yes.\n[01:11:36 - 01:12:20] Wojciech \u017bak : Sourdough is sort of... It has a tradition... I don't know what its history is, but everyone in every house somewhere.... Although maybe not everyone, no? But somewhere these grandmothers of ours were making these sourdoughs. Whether it was those so-called sour sours, or white borscht for soups, that is, they soured all sorts of grains. Here we are talking about beetroot for our traditional red borscht. In these traditional recipes, our grandmothers also threw in, for example, a slice of high-quality wholemeal bread as a starter with the bacterial cultures in the bread to start the fermentation process.\n[01:12:20 - 01:12:24] Malgorzata : And for you, what was the motivation to make these sourdoughs and these pickles?\n[01:12:26 - 01:15:40] Wojciech \u017bak : Motivation... Yes, because I sort of ... I knew sort of... I mean I just didn't know sourdough, beetroot. I was very fond of sort of borscht and so on. And it kind of came out by accident as well, because.... Which was already kind of going to waste. It was actually on the grater, it was very soft. And there wasn't really anything to do with it. Well there wasn't a strong water supply or anything. And suddenly I thought geez, well after all.... Now very... Since 2014, the fashion for pickles has come back in Poland. and precisely for these health aspects. There was also this theme that people who are on chemotherapy, this anti-cancer therapy, taking chemotherapy, should drink a lot of minerals, vitamins, but also iron, which is very important for strengthening the body, the circulatory system. So it was like there was already a very big, cool fashion, just maybe marketing it, and there were a lot of films coming out somewhere doing cool things like that. So there was just a fashion. And I just used the beetroot from our field, which was small and so on, and we just made a sourdough starter and as I took my first ever sip, because it's not red borscht, no? And it came out the first time at all, so I said, well it's nothing difficult to make. I was just shocked. In the taste. It was just my taste. It was a brilliant taste. Sweet, sour, slightly salty, a bit of spice. I say wow, no? It just made my taste buds go crazy. And it kind of connected the dots a little bit. Let's stop framing all these vegetables. Let's focus on a few. And let's set up a processing plant. On a local, manufacuture basis this one. We'll see how it works out for us. So basically that was the motivation, I mean that was the start and two motivations. The first is financial, to put it bluntly. In the sense that we're going to make a bigger margin on processed products. Well, and sort of developing the foundation, well we wanted to see that we might be able to make money on the sale of that and fund jobs for those people that somewhere in the normal labour market there wouldn't be a place for them because they would be made redundant very quickly. Very many examples. I have people, our employees, who worked 1-2 days and were dismissed. For various reasons, without going into details. So Philip is now working his third year. More than once he threw a rake because there something and said that this one, but.... Also even for one person sometimes it is worth doing something there.\n[01:15:41 - 01:15:50] Malgorzata : So if we were to summarise such key turning points in the foundation's history, what would they be?\n[01:15:50 - 01:16:51] Wojciech \u017bak : The first creation of a foundation at all. Milestones. Later, the start of cultivation. Well, that's it. Later, sort of a turning point. The beet wheelbarrow was a turning point. All of a sudden we found we could do something very good. These vegetables that we are growing, the spinach is tested for contamination related to heavy metals that are in the air. There have been tests carried out by Sanepid. The Sanepid is the one that we work with. All the registers, no? This is also important. So we have to have this legality of this activity and permits to sell and produce, no?\n[01:16:51 - 01:16:53] Malgorzata : Will they be in 1-3? They will be in 1.\n[01:16:53 - 01:16:57] Wojciech \u017bak : Because if they said no, for example, well, no, no?\n[01:16:57 - 01:16:59] Malgorzata : And what do you give them?\n[01:16:59 - 01:17:02] Wojciech \u017bak : What are we giving them? I don't know what we are giving them.\n[01:17:02 - 01:17:03] Malgorzata : Work.\n[01:17:04 - 01:17:46] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, jobs are given. So certainly, because it's legalising it as it were, no? Well, exactly, because it's very important. Anyway, I had a phone call some time today. Hey, wait. It was the lady from the PiWu who called about the inspections, right? These paperwork checks overwhelm them so much that they don't want to believe them anymore. There are more and more organic farmers who are giving up certification. They have WD, it's that stamp. We record it. If you want, I'll... No, no, all right, all right, well I sort of say it to myself, no? And, you know, and they're opting out because.... Because it.\n[01:17:46 - 01:17:49] Malgorzata : There are such challenges, no? Because it's also important what challenges they have.\n[01:17:49 - 01:17:55] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, yes, no. But that is not our challenge. We have consciously given it up. Also we don't have a stamp.\n[01:17:55 - 01:17:56] Malgorzata : Eco, right?\n[01:17:56 - 01:18:22] Wojciech \u017bak : That it is eco. We are not eco, no? In the sense of certification, no? And the Union doesn't do it either, I mean, you know, it's like, you can believe someone through their mouth, right? And often people, well, there are rules and so on, right? And I just think we're also moving in a direction where people have to trust agricultural producers, even if they're not certified, right?\n[01:18:22 - 01:18:28] Malgorzata : That is, you have all the production, everything is ecologically compliant with the system, you just don't have the certification.\n[01:18:28 - 01:19:23] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, exactly. And we can't say, for example, we can't write that this is an organic product, because that's what the EU prohibits us from doing, so we write natural product. And we tell all our customers that we grow vegetables in a sustainable way, like organic crops. And we only source from certified growers But immediately those we source from are certified, they won't be certified. And that can be a problem for us too, or we'll just stay with them and sort of trust them. We eat in such a way that the taste also defends itself, because it's like if you eat a cucumber from our bush fresh, Well, you know that it's unconventional cultivation, it's manicured cultivation, it's the taste of childhood, the taste of grandma, like from grandma's garden.\n[01:19:26 - 01:19:30] Malgorzata : That's right, the milestones, that is, were later beetroot and sourdough.\n[01:19:30 - 01:20:34] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, well it certainly was. The milestone was the transition to processing, the reduction in the types of vegetables, the cultivation and the transition to processing of those vegetables and the emergence of the sow ferment name and the whole graphic identity that was also a milestone, because it cost us a lot, but basically we were very happy with the whole way it looked. And that was confirmed. And it's which year? The 21st, in August, no? So that's for sure, which is good packaging, which is good preparation of the content, but also the packaging, no? And those were the milestones. And then the next ones we can say such for now, I mean it's probably just so quick, no? Because there would probably be a few more somewhere... Well, it's certainly the cooperation with the first such local chain of 13 shops in the Tri-City, no?\n[01:20:34 - 01:20:50] Malgorzata : Well, and today, if you would just talk about these biggest challenges that are involved in what you do, It's we talked about these certifications, but there are still some of these big challenges that you face?\n[01:20:51 - 01:22:34] Wojciech \u017bak : Keeping that cash flow, that cash in our, because we have to, well, sort of the challenges are, well, we sort of have to do everything legally, yeah, well, because we have to be holier than thou Pope, as they say, yeah. So we have to, we sort of employ everybody legally, we do our taxes, we do our social security, yeah. So the upkeep, but we also have to make sure that we get paid by the merchants, which is our customers, they pay us for what we bring to them, so that we can just have money for those salaries, so that's kind of what we're doing operationally, so definitely keeping the liquidity, that kind of functioning is one of the most important ones. The second is certainly maintaining the team, isn't it? Well, because gardening, on the other hand, is a kind of expertise, yes? And not everyone, well it's not that basic knowledge either, so it's kind of important to have a good team who know what they're doing, at least partly. Same on the processing plant, no? That's the thing. The challenges? Well also sort of this lack of time, no? That small management team, no? This one, let's say, or challenges related to marketing, challenges related to acquiring support from other sources, no? Financial. This is also a challenge, isn't it?\n[01:22:35 - 01:22:42] Malgorzata : And your biggest successes as a foundation? Is there something you are most excited about?\n[01:22:42 - 01:24:40] Wojciech \u017bak : Oh dear. I don't know. Well it's certainly nice that we are still functioning and have customers. I think that's the biggest success. That we are just pretty much already a recognisable brand locally. That we're in a lot of cool shops and that they want us and that basically even when I go, well yesterday I just walked in with a shoe to the lady and with a bottle and with an offer. The day before yesterday, sorry. No, yesterday. The day before yesterday I called and said, who runs a vegetable shop in Przymorze. And we became business partners, no? And we became business partners, right? So these are successes, I think, related to this very openness of entrepreneurs to our products, no? Despite the rather high price and so on. And this can also be a neighbourhood vegetable shop, where you, well, we'll try it, no? So it's definitely a success story. Formal ones we don't have, because we don't apply for any awards. We could get ourselves selected for numerous competitions. They invite us to, to put ourselves forward for some award there, but to write ourselves. I see it as such greenwashing a bit, in the sense that we don't need it a bit. That's how it seems to me. That's it. What else? Did we get it? There was something there. We got, and just, we got from the initiation forum, we won one of those smaller projects. just in this three-sector one and thanks to that we were able to buy and put up three, two foil tunnels, no? And that was also such a small success for us. I consider every collaboration with any of our partners a success.\n[01:24:40 - 01:24:49] Malgorzata : And I just wanted to ask you, because here you are very much active locally. Gdansk, I would say, will even help from what you say. And do you also operate nationally or internationally today?\n[01:24:52 - 01:24:56] Wojciech \u017bak : We sometimes sell our products to individual customers.\n[01:24:56 - 01:25:04] Malgorzata : In all this collaboration or communication, I don't know, so global, do you exist globally?\n[01:25:04 - 01:25:49] Wojciech \u017bak : No, it's not. We are local, but as an organisation we have just joined a project which will build such a self-help partnership related to social enterprises in Poland. where there will be a financial, self-help fund, where there will be some kind of joint communication. And it will also have some kind of a bearing on various legal and regulatory aspects, so that we can function better in this legal and regulatory environment and so on.\n[01:25:49 - 01:25:51] Malgorzata : And what is your goal now, the immediate one?\n[01:25:54 - 01:26:36] Wojciech \u017bak : The goal: Well to increase sales, which means to increase our revenue, turnover, what you call it, scalability. That's our biggest objective, which means it will also involve a certain stabilisation. And to become self-sustainable, so that we finance ourselves, as it were, only from our sales activities, right? This is our main objective. And, of course, a quantitative objective, in the sense that we would like to conquer Warsaw, for example, with our products.\n[01:26:37 - 01:26:46] Malgorzata : Ok. I still wanted to ask you if you had any advice to give to people who are in a similar business.\n[01:26:46 - 01:26:49] Wojciech \u017bak : The situation or something they would like to do, yes? Yes.\n[01:26:49 - 01:26:51] Malgorzata : Do you have any such advice you would like to share?\n[01:26:51 - 01:29:15] Wojciech \u017bak : Well, sure, always. You can call me. It sounds like a truism. I don't know, because I tell myself that all the time. Definitely some kind of perseverance and consistency in what you do. That is certainly important. You definitely need to have a good diagnosis of the local environment. That is to say, you also need to know who, what and where can help you. all these threads, right? I'm speaking as a representative of a non-governmental organisation on the one hand, but also, let's say, a business, let's say a local food producer, who cares about maintaining good relations with local government, business and the local environment. And so on. So in general, you also have to be of good quality in general. To be a trustworthy partner, that is, to build your trust, your credibility. Don't lie. Some people don't like someone telling the truth too much, do they? Truths, right? Because not everyone wants to listen to them. So to have that good relationship with the environment and the business too. Through customer acquisition. It's on the one hand the usual commercial activities, so door to door, and on the other hand somewhere personal or through somebody, so like that for sure. So there's that. And so to be, I think, an honest pupil to all sorts of inspections, yes, concerning permits and so on. And I think it's very important to regulate such activities in terms of formalities. It also gives you some kind of security that in the event of something there, so that there aren't any problems, no? But basically I think people who are involved in, but it's not, well, it's not. It's a bit of that kind of posturing, but....\n[01:29:15 - 01:29:36] Malgorzata : But let's just recap a little bit more, because we were talking about these actors that you work with, so we have the Local Government, we had the District Council and this social assistance from the city, so these are so, let's say, local, as far as the city administration is concerned. The state administration, that is, these either these competitions or controls all.\n[01:29:36 - 01:29:40] Wojciech \u017bak : Yes, but also legislation, no? Laws.\n[01:29:40 - 01:30:02] Malgorzata : And all these laws. We're also talking about NGOs, which are from different, different areas and fields. We were also talking about, of course, the business sector, where it could be either competitions, so some kind of larger partners, or just these shops, whether local, or some kind of deli, or these online sales.\n[01:30:02 - 01:30:03] Wojciech \u017bak : So-called merchants.\n[01:30:03 - 01:30:14] Malgorzata : Merchants. Later still that merchant, or customer last. We also talked about, education, that is, young people, kindergartens, where the school.\n[01:30:14 - 01:30:25] Wojciech \u017bak : I would also add that we were running, as I was going around the schools and just talking about the social economy, that is, these activities, that you combine business with social objectives.\n[01:30:26 - 01:30:42] Malgorzata : And we also talked about customers, i.e. those who buy pickles, but we also talked about catering, which is also your customer. About social media, which is where you communicate information though. And I think that's everyone we've mentioned.\n[01:30:42 - 01:30:47] Wojciech \u017bak : We haven't forgotten about... About some of these... We were talking about Sanitary.\n[01:30:49 - 01:30:56] Malgorzata : Which is to say. Well, then define further what this social economy is for you. As you in your own words know it.\n[01:30:56 - 01:33:36] Wojciech \u017bak : Hard work. The basics. Well, I have a problem... I would like... Maybe it's like asking what economics is to me, or what I'd like it to be, because what it is, right away. So... I mean, okay. So, by definition, the social economy combines business goals with social goals, which includes, as it were, people who have not always done well on the open labour market. It involves such people in business activities. Sometimes these are also cooperative activities, yes? Well, it can also be a social cooperative, where such people with various forms of social exclusion are simply joined together. So, unfortunately, at the moment, this social economy, this definition, because this approach, in what I think is a Polish example, has little to do with real business. which social, which self-finance. On the other hand, the social economy also does not replace, but rather substitutes a bit, i.e. at the request of the state, it provides services that the state does not have to provide, but commissions and organises non-governmental entities, such as social services, for example the running of various types of institutions, counselling centres, psychology. And I would like the social economy to be a really viable, self-sustaining business. where, like, business people are involved, but, like, activists who have good, comfortable conditions for creating just, providing just such jobs for people who are not quite there somewhere, no? So, but it's just, like, to make this business a formality related to some social welfare act or social economy act, but just to make it earn for itself and just be this business.\n[01:33:38 - 01:33:49] Malgorzata : Ok, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask one last thing like that, if there are any things like that, let's say, sensitive or delicate things that you would like to see removed from the interview or somewhere that were never removed.\n[01:33:49 - 01:33:51] Wojciech \u017bak : I don't know, but it will be the whole transcription?\n[01:33:51 - 01:33:54] Malgorzata : Because it's going to be a transcription of the text, so if there's something like that....\n[01:33:56 - 01:33:59] Wojciech \u017bak : Meaning or knowledge?\n[01:33:59 - 01:34:01] Malgorzata : But I ask formally so that you...\n[01:34:01 - 01:34:06] Wojciech \u017bak : But no, because it won't be, as someone said later, a public anti-interview.\n[01:34:06 - 01:34:12] Malgorzata : No, the interview is for scientific purposes. And, okay, well, okay. There's a video for the platform, and this is for scientific purposes.\n[01:34:12 - 01:34:16] Wojciech \u017bak : All right, all right, all right. Okay, that means no one's going to be there that....\n[01:34:17 - 01:34:26] Malgorzata : Well, I'm saying, I'm asking because if.... But I don't think you need to treat him. But you had a salepid moment, but it's known that you're... that you're not on bak.\n[01:34:26 - 01:34:27] Wojciech \u017bak : Okay, well...\n[01:34:27 - 01:34:31] Malgorzata : I think... that you would like to add something else?\n[01:34:31 - 01:34:35] Wojciech \u017bak : No, I don't think, I don't know, just already so, you know....\n[01:34:35 - 01:34:41] Malgorzata : If you have any questions, I'm always happy to text someone from the team to me too. Okay, that's me, thank you.\n[01:34:26 - 01:34:27] Wojciech \u017bak (interview - founder and president of the foundation) : Okay, well...\n[01:34:27 - 01:34:31] Malgorzata : I think... that you would like to add something else?\n[01:34:31 - 01:34:35] Wojciech \u017bak (interview - founder and president of the foundation) : No, I don't think, I don't know, just already so, you know....\n[01:34:35 - 01:34:41] Malgorzata : If you have any questions, I'm always happy to text someone from the team to me too. Okay, that's me, thank you.\n"}, {"PROJECT": "FR-048", "YEAR": 2024, "MONTH": "April", "NAME": "Laiterie La Chapelle", "DESCRIPTION": "Transforme un lait cru local issu d\u2019une seule ferme francilienne, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 35 km de Paris dans le Val d\u2019Oise.

At the La Chapelle dairy, we fetch milk from the Val d'Oise, pour it into R\u00e9gis-Pontoise, three times a week, to transform it into dairy products and raw milk cheese, and market it, mainly at the dairy and then in a small network of grocery shops, for example.\n[00:00:32 - 00:00:37] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Could you tell me about your different products and other activities, if any?\n[00:00:37 - 00:01:48] Olivier : Yes, so here we have the bulk of the range of dairy products, starting with pasteurised milk, yoghurts, desserts such as riolet, cr\u00e8me revers\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me choco, fromage frais, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and then the speciality is the mature cheeses which are also produced here, so made from raw cow's milk. More the tomes family, with tomes that are more or less supple, more or less matured, blue-veined, so blue, small fresh cheeses, small lactic cheeses that are a little less matured, and raquettes which are also part of the range, the emblematic cheese of the range. So that's basically the range as we present it today and our other activity is workshops, where we offer people the chance to discover the cheese-making trade and teach them how to make their own cheeses, which we undertake to mature for them for 3 months, so that after 3 months they can come and collect their own mature cheeses.\n[00:01:48 - 00:01:56] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : What other players are you working with? So there's this grocery shop network, are there any other structures you can think of?\n[00:01:56 - 00:02:50] Olivier : A network of grocery shops and cheese shops that sell our products. A cargo bike company, because the idea was that we also wanted to be able to work with these grocery shops, but still with this short circuit approach, with a moderate and responsible carbon footprint, using a cargo bike for all our deliveries. The networks of players are essentially the milk producer, who is the main player we'll be working with and the essential raw material for our business, and a slightly larger network of players for all the other inputs, i.e. the ingredients we'll be using, almost all of which are organic and on which we'll be working.\n[00:02:52 - 00:03:07] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : I'm in. What advice would you give to someone who wants to set up a dairy or any other project as part of a food transition?\n[00:03:07 - 00:04:20] Olivier : What I would advise is that we should have the desire, the pleasure of working that guides us, that is guided to us, that continues to guide us and I think it's really important to want to come to work and these are projects that are so exciting but very time-consuming and that take a lot of time to set up and to run on a day-to-day basis, so at least love what you're planning to do and be sure you want to work on it. Necessarily, a bit of organisation, but not particularly managerial skills, whatever it may be, that's something you learn. After that, of course, you have to do it and you have to do it rigorously. Another little plus is that I think it's a good idea not to do it alone, or if not alone, at least well accompanied or surrounded. That's one of the important things, I think, in the day-to-day life of entrepreneurs in this sector.\n[00:04:20 - 00:04:25] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : And finally, to what extent do you see yourselves playing a part in the food transition?\n[00:04:25 - 00:04:32] Olivier : In one way or another? To what extent? To an extent that is relative to what we are all built up to be.\n[00:04:32 - 00:04:35] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : But you did talk to me about ecology and short circuits.\n[00:04:35 - 00:06:35] Olivier : Yes, no, actually, it's more an approach that responds to desires and values that we want to share, that we've made our own and that enable people in a district that's a little out of the way from Paris, in a district that we'd describe as working-class, to suddenly find dairy products that are accessible, simply and well produced. For example, we have a lot of families who are delighted to find milk in returnable bottles with us and who tell us that we've reduced our waste, both from milk bottles and yoghurt, because all of a sudden we've made what I'd call a relative saving, but which in the end, in our day-to-day lives, is obvious, a saving on plastic and containers. And then there's education too. All these families and their children are growing up with returnable containers. A lot of people from the grandparents generation say that when we were little, we used to return them. My generation didn't do that. My parents' generation hardly ever did. And now, all of a sudden, we have lots of children who understand what instructions are. They're 5, 6 years old. And they're going to grow up with it. So it's pretty cool too, on a small scale, on a few streets in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. All of a sudden, it can have an impact on people's homes and consumption patterns, a very tangible influence. And that's pretty cool.\n"}, {"PROJECT": "CH-004", "YEAR": 2024, "MONTH": "April", "NAME": "Les Vergers d'Epicure", "DESCRIPTION": "Les Vergers d\u2019Epicure sont une coop\u00e9rative de type agriculture contractuelle, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s dans la culture et la r\u00e9colte de fruits ainsi que dans la \nproduction de leurs d\u00e9riv\u00e9s (jus, confiture, sirop, vin,, etc).", "COUNTRY": "Switzerland", "GEOGRAPHY": "Switzerland", "FILE": "CH-004_interview_video.MOV.csv", "TYPE": "interview", "RECORD LANG": "fr", "RECORD FILE": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aUSA_SCzV0cshnqQuQ-nKgjtOVjXcav6", "TRANSCRIPT": "[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Alors est-ce que vous pourriez vous pr\u00e9senter et me pr\u00e9senter l'h\u00e9berger des piq\u00fbres ?\n[00:00:03 - 00:00:18] Brigitte : Alors Brigitte Schneider-Bideau, infirmi\u00e8re de m\u00e9tier et je dirais chef de culture des h\u00e9bergers des piq\u00fbres et j'en ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sidente pendant dix ans.\n[00:00:18 - 00:00:22] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Quel est votre r\u00f4le, exactement de quoi est-ce que vous vous occupez ?\n[00:00:22 - 00:00:35] Brigitte : Des cultures, surtout, principalement, et de faire des appels aux coop\u00e9rateurs pour venir les deadlines pour les travaux \u00e0 faire \u00e0 effectuer dans l'ann\u00e9e.\n[00:00:35 - 00:00:39] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Est-ce que vous pourriez nous pr\u00e9senter un petit peu les vergers d'\u00e9picure ?\n[00:00:39 - 00:01:16] Brigitte : Alors les vergers d'\u00e9picure c'est une... comment dire... c'est une initiative de Christian Pavarelle et de trois ou quatre autres personnes pour cr\u00e9er cette coop\u00e9rative agricole sur un r\u00eave de travailler en commun et d'\u00eatre proche de la terre.

So if you start bringing them food, they'll start to rely on it very quickly. And they would. Yeah, they could be tamed and become pets very easily. So we have to sort of hold that off a bit. But on the other hand, we need to be able to catch them. And we've got some bagots. They're a rare breed. They're very good. They're a lot more hardy. They can be kept outside with no shelters, but they are very flighty and they've got that wild heritage in them still.

That's what we do. And there's a bit in our milkers agreement where we say that even the retired milkers will go for meat. They don't get to live out in green, lush fields the rest of their lives because again, that's part of being sustainable and not overusing resources unnecessarily.

Eh bien, du coup, je veux bien qu'on pr\u00e9sente le projet.\n[00:01:05 - 00:02:58] Olivia Boutay : Alors, la ferme des Vergers, elle travaille sur quatre axes principaux. On entretient l'ensemble du quartier des Vergers. Donc, c'est un gros quartier d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 3000 habitants sur \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 16 hectares. Donc, on a 16 hectares en entretien. Donc c'est de l'entretien paysager tr\u00e8s extensif. Et puis on est labellis\u00e9 bio aussi, selon les normes du label Bio Suisse, en entretien. Et puis aussi sur notre deuxi\u00e8me axe qui est la production agricole. Donc au sein du quartier des Verg\u00e9s, on produit des l\u00e9gumes sur \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s un demi hectare, aussi en bio. Et on est en train d'acqu\u00e9rir, enfin d'acqu\u00e9rir, d'avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des nouvelles surfaces. Donc on va augmenter un peu nos superficies \u00e0 partir de l'ann\u00e9e prochaine. \u00c7a c'est le deuxi\u00e8me axe. On a un axe tr\u00e8s important qui est l'aspect sensibilisation. C'est-\u00e0-dire qu'on organise que ce soit des visites, des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pour le grand public, aussi beaucoup pour des classes qui vont de la cr\u00e8che jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9cole secondaire. Donc on se donne vraiment cette vocation d'avoir un lien \u00e9troit avec toutes sortes de publics faire des communications, faire participer les gens, les int\u00e9grer un petit peu dans ce processus. Et puis sensibiliser aussi sur des th\u00e8mes qui sont importants pour nous, l'alimentation, la sant\u00e9, la durabilit\u00e9, etc. Et puis notre tout nouvel axe qu'on a d\u00e9marr\u00e9 ce printemps, c'est la transformation. Je vous en parlais un petit peu avec la l\u00e9gumerie. Donc on a cr\u00e9\u00e9, en collaboration avec la commune de M\u00e9rin qui nous a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 investir, une l\u00e9gumerie dans nos locaux. Donc c'est un local dans lequel on transforme des l\u00e9gumes non cuits. On appelle \u00e7a la quatri\u00e8me gamme en.\n[00:02:58 - 00:03:01] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Suisse, je ne sais pas si c'est pareil en France.\n[00:03:01 - 00:03:39] Olivia Boutay : Donc c'est lav\u00e9, \u00e9pluch\u00e9, d\u00e9coup\u00e9 et mis sous vide. Il n'y a pas de cuisson. Donc \u00e7a peut \u00eatre des pommes de terre en forme de frites, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre de la carotte r\u00e2p\u00e9e, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre des p\u00e9traves en petits d\u00e9s. Donc ils sont destin\u00e9s ensuite \u00e0 de la pr\u00e9paration en cuisine. Et puis \u00e7a on l'a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 parce que depuis longtemps on voulait travailler, enfin on travaille depuis longtemps en collaboration avec les cantines scolaires de la commune de M\u00e9rin. Mais on \u00e9tait toujours limit\u00e9 par le fait que ces cuisines ne sont pas \u00e9quip\u00e9es ni en ressources humaines, ni en espaces pour transformer des l\u00e9gumes qui viennent du champ. Et donc cet \u00e9chelon-l\u00e0 qui manquait, on l'a cr\u00e9\u00e9 au sein de la ferme.\n[00:03:39 - 00:03:44] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord. Et comment est-ce que l'initiative est n\u00e9e du coup ?\n[00:03:44 - 00:06:29] Olivia Boutay : L'initiative de la ferme ? Oui. En fait, \u00e7a vient de la cr\u00e9ation du quartier des vergers, qui est un nouveau quartier, \u00e9coquartier, sur M\u00e9rin, et puis qui se voulait exemplaire \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents titres, que ce soit au niveau de l'habitat, mais aussi notamment au niveau de ces espaces verts. Et puis au niveau de la participation, la commune a mis beaucoup d'accent sur la question de la participation dans le quartier des vergers avec l'int\u00e9gration des habitants de M\u00e9rin qui \u00e9taient l\u00e0 avant le quartier et puis des futurs habitants aussi qui \u00e9taient connus tr\u00e8s en avant dans le projet parce que la commune a confi\u00e9 tous ces terrains qu'elle avait en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 des coop\u00e9ratives d'habitation. et donc on avait toute une esp\u00e8ce de r\u00e9servoir de futurs habitants qui \u00e9taient l\u00e0 et qui avaient envie de s'investir pour leur futur quartier. Et donc \u00e0 partir de \u00e7a, la commune a mis en place toute une d\u00e9marche participative et notamment a organis\u00e9 un grand forum, \u00e7a c'\u00e9tait en 2014, o\u00f9 toutes les personnes qui avaient envie de s'investir dans ce quartier, que ce soit des futurs habitants, des habitants de M\u00e9rin, etc. ont pu arriver avec leurs id\u00e9es et puis l'objectif de ce forum c'\u00e9tait un peu de partager des id\u00e9es et puis de faire se rencontrer les gens autour de th\u00e9matiques qui pouvaient les int\u00e9resser en commun et de ce forum ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9 plusieurs initiatives en fait. Alors c'est pas de l\u00e0 que vient la ferme mais de ce forum ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9 notamment l'initiative de la FEV avec l'id\u00e9e de cr\u00e9er un supermarch\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent avec des possibilit\u00e9s de faire des choix en conscience d'aliments, etc. Et donc il y a un groupe qui a travaill\u00e9 sur ce projet qui a abouti \u00e0 la FEV, mais Sabine vous en parlera mieux que moi. Et puis au moment o\u00f9 ce quartier a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 voir le jour, on s'est rendu compte qu'il y avait en fait beaucoup d'initiatives qui tournaient autour de l'alimentation avec la FEV, la cr\u00e9ation d'une auberge aussi pour la valorisation des produits. On parlait aussi de transformation avec diff\u00e9rents artisans, etc. Et puis \u00e0 un moment, on s'est dit, mais en fait, ce quartier, il est construit sur une ancienne zone agricole. Il a un pass\u00e9 agricole. Et puis, \u00e7a serait int\u00e9ressant de garder une agriculture, une forme d'agriculture dans ce quartier. Et \u00e0 partir de \u00e7a, on a travaill\u00e9 sur les espaces verts. Et puis, la commune a fait un appel \u00e0 candidature, un appel \u00e0 projet. que des \u00e9quipes soumissionnent pour entretenir le quartier avec cet aspect production.\n[00:06:29 - 00:06:30] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[00:06:30 - 00:06:30] Olivia Boutay : Voil\u00e0.\n[00:06:30 - 00:06:39] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Du coup il y avait un vrai terreau fertile \u00e0 l'\u00e9mergence de ces initiatives. Est-ce qu'il y a eu des obstacles au d\u00e9but, malgr\u00e9 tout, des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0.\n[00:06:39 - 00:07:27] Olivia Boutay : Monter le projet ? Pour la ferme, je dirais que \u00e7a s'est quand m\u00eame fait de mani\u00e8re... En fait, il a fallu convaincre le conseil municipal. D\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 le conseil municipal a \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu, \u00e7a s'est fait de mani\u00e8re assez organique, finalement. mais parce que le travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en amont par d'autres groupes. Une des grosses difficult\u00e9s qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour la ferme, c'\u00e9tait de passer par cet appel \u00e0 candidature parce que c'\u00e9tait un appel d'offre au march\u00e9 public ouvert et donc potentiellement il y avait quand m\u00eame beaucoup de concurrence avec d'autres initiatives qui auraient pu \u00eatre propos\u00e9es.\n[00:07:27 - 00:07:37] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord, ok. Et par rapport \u00e0 la FES du coup, comment est-ce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'initiative ?\n[00:07:37 - 00:09:08] Sabine Bally : En fait, c'est vraiment, \u00e7a remonte \u00e0 ce forum citoyen de 2014, et comme elle l'a dit, il y a eu plusieurs projets qui ont pris diff\u00e9rentes formes, il y a vraiment eu cette axe autour de l'alimentation, et depuis l\u00e0, il y a une sorte de projet alimentaire de quartier. et qui est principalement incarn\u00e9e aujourd'hui dans quatre coop\u00e9ratives diff\u00e9rentes. Donc la coop\u00e9rative qui m'emploie, celle qui a le magasin de distribution dans le c\u0153ur du quartier, la coop\u00e9rative de la ferme des bergers, qui produit dans le quartier et qui fait le lien avec les autres fermes qui approvisionnent le magasin, parce que finalement \u00e7a reste qu'une vitrine, \u00e7a ne suffit pas du tout ce demi hectare pour nourrir le quartier. Donc il y a vraiment cette vocation de sensibilisation qui est un des p\u00f4les principaux de la ferme. Apr\u00e8s il y a la coop\u00e9rative des ateliers paysans qui s'occupe de trois ateliers de transformation dans le quartier, une boulangerie, une fromagerie et une boucherie. Et puis la quatri\u00e8me a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e, c'est l'auberge des vergers. Et c'est ce qu'on appelle nous aujourd'hui la fili\u00e8re alimentaire des vergers, donc c'est ce projet alimentaire. Et voil\u00e0, moi je vous ai dit que j'\u00e9tais la coordinatrice de la fili\u00e8re alimentaire, mais en fait je suis engag\u00e9e par le supermarch\u00e9 participatif paysan, parce que la gouvernance, c'est peut-\u00eatre un peu technique, mais finalement aujourd'hui, juridiquement, il n'y a pas d'entit\u00e9 pour ce projet alimentaire. Il existe encore, il est encore sous-fractionn\u00e9.\n[00:09:08 - 00:09:10] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Oui, sous toutes ces petites unit\u00e9s.\n[00:09:10 - 00:09:11] Sabine Bally : Exactement, oui.\n[00:09:11 - 00:09:11] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[00:09:12 - 00:09:38] Olivia Boutay : Mais parce qu'en fait c'est plusieurs initiatives qui se sont cr\u00e9\u00e9es, \u00e9videmment qui sont interd\u00e9pendantes, qui se sont cr\u00e9\u00e9es un peu l'une de par l'autre, etc. Mais qui ont quand m\u00eame chacune leur ind\u00e9pendance, m\u00eame si \u00e9videmment il y a un travail qui est fait en commun. Il y a une interd\u00e9pendance qui est l\u00e0 clairement, mais chacune est quand m\u00eame ind\u00e9pendante l'une de l'autre juridiquement.\n[00:09:39 - 00:10:08] Sabine Bally : Mais par exemple, le lien avec les cuisines scolaires, en fait, il est port\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois par la ferme des bergers et par cette structure de la fili\u00e8re alimentaire des bergers. Donc tout est un peu \u00e0 double, mais il y a vraiment, en tout cas, dans ce microcosme, la ferme a ce r\u00f4le de faire le lien avec les autres fermes qui existent. Et c'est quand m\u00eame assez important de souligner \u00e7a, parce qu'effectivement, on pourrait se dire Ah ben voil\u00e0, c'est ce qu'on voit l\u00e0 qui nourrit les \u00e9coles de M\u00e9run et comme \u00e7a, mais c'est plus...\n[00:10:08 - 00:10:12] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : C'est la ferme m\u00e8re, en fait, quelque part.\n[00:10:12 - 00:10:14] Sabine Bally : C'est la ferme vitrine, je pense, plus que m\u00eame.\n[00:10:14 - 00:10:17] Olivia Boutay : Oui, c'est la ferme qui fait le lien.\n[00:10:17 - 00:10:27] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Ouais. D'accord. Et du coup, dans chaque structure, est-ce que vous pourriez me d\u00e9tailler peut-\u00eatre un petit peu qui sont les personnes, quel r\u00f4le, d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la ferme des vergers ?\n[00:10:27 - 00:11:56] Olivia Boutay : Alors, dans la ferme des vergers, on est neuf personnes en \u00e9quipe permanente. Et puis, il faut que je vous d\u00e9crive les r\u00f4les de ces personnes. Oui, alors, on a... Vous voulez des noms ? Non, bon, nous on fonctionne en gouvernance partag\u00e9e. Donc on est sous forme horizontale. Donc on a une r\u00e9union d'\u00e9quipe chaque semaine, on d\u00e9cide les choses ensemble, etc. \u00c7a c'est important. comment on fonctionne. Et puis on a un autre principe qui est qu'on n'a pas des r\u00f4les extr\u00eamement d\u00e9finis, on essaye de faire un petit peu tous-tout. Alors \u00e9videmment qu'on a des responsabilit\u00e9s qui sont quand m\u00eame r\u00e9parties et puis chacun est un petit peu plus investi dans un p\u00f4le ou l'autre, mais il y a quand m\u00eame des moments o\u00f9 on fait des choses tous ensemble, etc. Donc on a \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s trois postes et demi en \u00e9quivalent plein temps qui sont d\u00e9volus \u00e0 l'entretien. Donc l\u00e0, on fait les fauches, les d\u00e9sherbages, les tontes. On fait aussi tout ce qui est ramassage des d\u00e9chets dans le quartier. Pas les gros d\u00e9chets, mais tout ce qui est corbeilles de d\u00e9chets dans le quartier, pince \u00e0 papier, etc. Voil\u00e0, c'est pour l'entretien. En production, on a deux personnes qui sont charg\u00e9es de faire le plan de culture, de faire le suivi des cultures, etc.\n[00:11:57 - 00:12:02] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : L\u00e0, la production, quand on s'est promen\u00e9, \u00e7a a lieu o\u00f9 exactement ?\n[00:12:02 - 00:12:15] Olivia Boutay : \u00c0 l'extr\u00eame oppos\u00e9e du quartier. L\u00e0, on n'est pas dans le quartier des Vergers. Il est vraiment juste de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la route de M\u00e9run. D\u00e8s que vous traversez la route, vous \u00eates dans le quartier des Vergers. Et puis ensuite, c'est un gros ensemble.\n[00:12:15 - 00:12:16] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord, c'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y a les produits.\n[00:12:18 - 00:12:22] Olivia Boutay : Oui, tout \u00e0 fait. Mais c'est pas loin. Oui, le plus loin, c'est \u00e0 500 m\u00e8tres d'ici.\n[00:12:22 - 00:12:22] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[00:12:22 - 00:12:33] Olivia Boutay : OK. Voil\u00e0. Sinon, on a une personne... En fait, on a trois personnes qui travaillent dans la l\u00e9guberie, mais chacun \u00e0 un taux tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s faible, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 20%.\n[00:12:33 - 00:12:34] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[00:12:34 - 00:13:29] Olivia Boutay : Parce que l'activit\u00e9 de transformation, c'est bien de la faire \u00e0 plusieurs, mais sur un temps finalement assez court. Donc, ils travaillent ensemble, les trois. On a M\u00e9lanie, que vous avez vue dans l'autre bureau, qui s'occupe de l'administration. \u00e0 60%. Et puis, je crois que c'est tout. Voil\u00e0, c'est \u00e7a. Et puis, apr\u00e8s, on a plein d'autres personnes qui gravitent l\u00e0 autour. En \u00e9t\u00e9, on prend beaucoup de stagiaires. Il y a une \u00e9cole \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve qui forme les ing\u00e9nieurs agronomes et puis gestionnaires de la nature qui doivent faire un stage, 10 mois de stage, je crois, avant leurs \u00e9tudes. On a beaucoup de futurs \u00e9tudiants qui viennent ici. On accueille des b\u00e9n\u00e9voles. Durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9, souvent, on engage des temporaires pour nous donner des coups de main. Donc voil\u00e0, on peut avoir des \u00e9quipes qui sont assez importantes.\n[00:13:29 - 00:13:30] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Et au niveau de la f\u00eate, du.\n[00:13:30 - 00:13:50] Sabine Bally : Coup, c'est structur\u00e9 comment ? Donc nous, on est 3,2 \u00e9quivalents temps plein, r\u00e9partis en cinq personnes. Et sinon, c'est vraiment, peut-\u00eatre avant de dire \u00e7a, c'est vraiment participatif depuis le d\u00e9but, c'est dans l'ADN du projet, donc il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de choses qui sont faites par des b\u00e9n\u00e9voles, par des membres.\n[00:13:50 - 00:13:53] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord. C'est assez fluctuant ?\n[00:13:53 - 00:16:04] Sabine Bally : Tout \u00e0 fait. Et il y a des \u00e9quipes de travail et tout \u00e7a qui sont compl\u00e8tement b\u00e9n\u00e9voles. Mais apr\u00e8s, donc on a cinq postes de travail, il y en a quelqu'un qui s'occupe de la participation. juste de la gestion en fait de tous ces b\u00e9n\u00e9voles et de l'entretien et du soin \u00e0 donner \u00e0 \u00e7a parce qu'en fait \u00e7a demande pas mal de travail quand m\u00eame. Il y a quelqu'un qui s'occupe de la gestion du magasin, il y a le coordinateur des ventes contractuelles donc \u00e7a reste un p\u00f4le tr\u00e8s important pour le projet alimentaire de dire ok il y a un magasin mais il y a aussi toute cette l'\u00e9volution de l'AMAP en fait, la naissance du projet, du projet de quartier, c'est vraiment de se dire comment on peut passer \u00e0 une autre \u00e9chelle en partant du mod\u00e8le AMAP, faire quelque chose non pas pour une famille qui s'engage aupr\u00e8s d'une ferme, mais pour tout un quartier. Et du coup, la notion contractuelle, elle est tr\u00e8s importante et c'est celle-l\u00e0 aussi qui est mise en avant dans les liens qu'on a avec la commune, avec les collectivit\u00e9s publiques, et c'est ce que la l\u00e9gumerie essaye de faire, c'est d'avoir un contrat annuel. et les fermes qui font partie du coll\u00e8ge des paysans qui approvisionne le magasin, elles partagent un plan de production annuel et il y a un contrat annuel entre le magasin et les diff\u00e9rents d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s et ce coll\u00e8ge des paysans. \u00c7a c'est vraiment quelque chose d'assez unique. Donc il y a diff\u00e9rentes fermes qui se mettent d'accord et qui se r\u00e9partissent un march\u00e9. Et donc \u00e7a c'est vraiment sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 ce projet et c'est assez compliqu\u00e9. Mais c'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il n'y a plus la concurrence entre des gens qui font la m\u00eame chose et \u00e7a va m\u00eame, \u00e7a rentre m\u00eame dans la planification. Et donc on a quelqu'un qui s'occupe de la coordination des demandes contractuelles et qui fait la coordination de ces diff\u00e9rents paysans participatifs, donc de ces diff\u00e9rentes fermes. Aujourd'hui il y a cinq fermes. Et apr\u00e8s il y a quelqu'un qui fait de l'administration et puis il y a moi qui est la coordination un peu \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 l'interne et aussi avec les diff\u00e9rents projets qui existent, et puis avec les collectivit\u00e9s publiques et tout \u00e7a.\n[00:16:04 - 00:16:04] Olivia Boutay : OK.\n[00:16:04 - 00:16:08] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Oui, c'est \u00e0 vous que vous allez r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir.\n[00:16:08 - 00:17:03] Sabine Bally : Mais puisqu'on d\u00e9veloppe aussi d'autres projets, donc on est en cours l\u00e0 de passer \u00e0 un magasin beaucoup plus grand. Et l'id\u00e9e c'est en fait de ne plus parler de magasin, en fait de r\u00e9ellement rentrer dans quelque chose d'autre, mais il nous manque malheureusement le vocabulaire. Qu'est-ce que c'est si c'est plus un magasin ? Et on travaille aussi sur un syst\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale de l'alimentation. En Suisse, on parle plut\u00f4t d'assurance sociale de l'alimentation. Mais donc, on lance diff\u00e9rents projets autour de l'alimentation. Et donc, une partie de mon travail de coordination va au-del\u00e0, en fait, juste de la dimension supermarch\u00e9 participatif paysan. Parce qu'en fait, finalement, tout \u00e7a, \u00e7a nourrit ce projet alimentaire qui est plus large. Donc on est tous, on d\u00e9passe tous un peu notre sph\u00e8re en fait de notre coop\u00e9rative qui nous engage.\n[00:17:03 - 00:17:16] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Oui c'est une forme d'exp\u00e9rimentation limit\u00e9e entre guillemets \u00e0 un quartier mais avec pour perspective de pouvoir \u00e9tendre \u00e7a peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 d'autres serveurs de mod\u00e8les peut-\u00eatre ?\n[00:17:16 - 00:17:36] Sabine Bally : Oui plut\u00f4t mod\u00e8les reproductibles que mod\u00e8les extensifs. Et d'ailleurs, une partie du travail que je fais un peu moi, c'est aussi de travailler avec des personnes qui r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent \u00e0 d'autres quartiers sur Gen\u00e8ve, et voir comment on peut reproduire \u00e7a, comment on peut int\u00e9grer un projet alimentaire dans un nouveau quartier et tout \u00e7a.\n[00:17:36 - 00:17:41] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord. Et La F\u00e8ve est n\u00e9e la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e que la Ferme des Virgines ?\n[00:17:41 - 00:17:42] Olivia Boutay : Non, plut\u00f4t.\n[00:17:42 - 00:17:43] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Plut\u00f4t, d'accord.\n[00:17:43 - 00:17:49] Sabine Bally : La F\u00e8ve est n\u00e9e... 2017, je crois. Le magasin a ouvert en 2018, et puis l'AG Constitutif, c'\u00e9tait en 2017. D'accord.\n[00:17:51 - 00:17:56] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Et pareil, vous avez rencontr\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s pour la mise en place ?\n[00:17:56 - 00:17:58] Sabine Bally : Oui, \u00e9norm\u00e9ment.\n[00:17:58 - 00:18:02] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Je vais pas vous d\u00e9tailler parce que c'est assez important. Oui, oui.\n[00:18:02 - 00:18:04] Sabine Bally : Toi t'\u00e9tais plus l\u00e0 que moi, mais...\n[00:18:04 - 00:18:09] Olivia Boutay : Par rapport \u00e0... Ouais, l\u00e0, non, moi j'ai pas beaucoup suivi les questions de l'ouverture de la f\u00eate.\n[00:18:09 - 00:19:58] Sabine Bally : Le premier obstacle vraiment cons\u00e9quent et qui en fait r\u00e9sume tout tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s bien, c'est que Donc un quartier de 3000 habitants, c'est pas si grand que \u00e7a, mais \u00e7a pose quand m\u00eame la question de quel distributeur vient s'installer l\u00e0. Et une des chances du projet, c'est que les deux grands distributeurs suisses qui dominent le march\u00e9, c'est la COP et la Migros, ont refus\u00e9 de venir s'installer l\u00e0 parce que c'\u00e9tait trop petit. Donc c'\u00e9tait la chance en fait de pouvoir avoir un espace et s'installer l\u00e0. Sauf que le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble, au dernier moment, il s'est quand m\u00eame retir\u00e9 et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une sous-sucursale d'un des grands distributeurs, donc Migrovoi \u00e7a s'appelle. Donc en fait le premier obstacle c'\u00e9tait de trouver quelqu'un qui fasse confiance \u00e0 ce projet et qui donne un espace en fait en rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, abordable quoi. Donc \u00e7a c'\u00e9tait le premier obstacle parce que tous les plans financiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour une surface de 600 m\u00b2 qui est juste l\u00e0 en bas et finalement elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue. Donc l'autre coop\u00e9ratif qui s'occupe des ateliers de transformation, tous les travaux et tout \u00e7a ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits avec cette surface de vente en t\u00eate et encore aujourd'hui on ne l'a pas. Donc c'est tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9. \u00c7a reste un obstacle qu'on rencontre, enfin qui p\u00e8se aujourd'hui. Donc on a pass\u00e9 de 60m\u00b2 \u00e0 aujourd'hui 120m\u00b2, mais on n'est pas encore au 500m\u00b2 et il y a eu une rectification du plan directeur de quartier port\u00e9 par la commune et qui a accept\u00e9 la construction d'un grand supermarch\u00e9 de 500m\u00b2 et il y a eu un recours des habitants. Donc en fait, \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, il y a eu l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir la surface n\u00e9cessaire. Donc \u00e7a, c'est s\u00fbr que pour un magasin, c'est compliqu\u00e9 s'il n'y a pas la surface, mais bon.\n[00:19:58 - 00:20:03] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Malgr\u00e9 le fait que vous vous situez dans un \u00e9coquartier qui se veut justement... OK.\n[00:20:03 - 00:21:35] Olivia Boutay : C'est pas si simple en fait. Non, parce que tous ces projets, ils sont arriv\u00e9s en cours de route, en fait. Et puis en Suisse, je sais pas si vous savez un peu comment \u00e7a se passe, la construction, mais on fait, avant m\u00eame la construction, on fait un plan localis\u00e9 de quartier qui fixe, en fait, tous les gabarits des b\u00e2timents. Puis apr\u00e8s, l\u00e0-dessus, il y a des projets d'architecture qui doivent rentrer dans ces gabarits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9fix\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s, il y a la construction, etc. M\u00eame dans ce plan localis\u00e9 de quartier, il y a un plan et puis un r\u00e8glement qui dit qu'est-ce qu'on va faire, \u00e0 quel endroit, etc. Et chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui doit d\u00e9roger \u00e0 ce plan, ensuite, il doit \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 l'autorisation, etc. Et c'est extr\u00eamement compliqu\u00e9 de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 ce plan. Nous, on a eu cette difficult\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la mise en place de tunnels, parce qu'au moment o\u00f9 on a dit, on va faire de la culture, on a dit tout de suite, si on fait du l\u00e9gume, il nous faut des tunnels mara\u00eechers. Et pour \u00e7a, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 une ann\u00e9e et demie de proc\u00e9dure, de demande d'autorisation, en d\u00e9rogeant au plan localis\u00e9 de quartier, il a fallu attendre le d\u00e9lai de recours, etc. Alors nous, on a eu de la chance, personne n'a recouru contre nos tunnels, mais sinon, on n'aurait pas eu nos tunnels. Et l\u00e0, c'\u00e9tait pareil. Et puis \u00e7a, c'est vraiment, \u00e7a vient vraiment du fait qu'en fait, Au moment o\u00f9 ce plan de localisation de quartier a \u00e9t\u00e9 pens\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait il y a 20 ans peut-\u00eatre, et tous ces projets n'existaient pas, ils n'\u00e9taient m\u00eame pas dans la t\u00eate de quelqu'un. Donc apr\u00e8s il a fallu s'adapter au contexte et aux contraintes qui existaient.\n[00:21:35 - 00:21:42] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Et du coup aujourd'hui, que ce soit pour la ferme ou la FEV, quelle difficult\u00e9 vous rencontrez au quotidien ?\n[00:21:42 - 00:24:04] Sabine Bally : Alors, je pense qu'un probl\u00e8me principal pour ce projet de magasin participatif paysan dans le quartier, c'est la non-rencontre de son public et la diff\u00e9rence entre l'id\u00e9e du projet et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir l'id\u00e9e c'est un projet pour un quartier entier et un approvisionnement pour les gens qui y habitent, Et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, c'est qu'il y a \u00e0 peine 10% du quartier qui vient. Donc en fait, la plus grande difficult\u00e9, c'est de rencontrer le public. Et c'est l'\u00e9chec de cette communication, en fait. Et \u00e7a, je pense que c'est vraiment un point central sur lequel il faut travailler. Et dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 actuelle, qui est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 marchande, tous ces projets un peu utopiques, ou qui mettent des valeurs en avant, ils se font dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 il y a une concurrence folle. Et finalement, pour quelque chose d'aussi peu cher que l'alimentation, \u00e7a fait partie de la libert\u00e9 de choix, de d\u00e9cider o\u00f9 on va acheter son repas du soir et qu'est-ce qu'on va cuisiner. Donc de changer \u00e7a, \u00c7a fait partie du projet et c'est un des obstacles majeurs parce qu'on voit bien que c'est un travail de fond en fait. Et qu'il va demander encore un peu de temps pour vraiment pouvoir le surmonter. Donc des projets comme la caisse alimentaire, cette s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale de l'alimentation ou d'autres choses sont des petites graines pour continuer \u00e0 travailler en fait le probl\u00e8me de fond qui est celui de l'engagement de chacun et de cette notion un peu d'alimentation en tant que commun. Parce que c'\u00e9tait vraiment \u00e7a l'id\u00e9e du projet de quartier de dire on met l'alimentation comme quelque chose qu'on va g\u00e9rer ensemble et l'id\u00e9e elle fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien mais la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c'est que personne ne veut g\u00e9rer. Enfin, il y a peu de gens qui adh\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette... Ils louent ici un appartement. Ils n'ont pas sign\u00e9 pour qu'on leur dise ce qu'ils doivent manger, en fait. M\u00eame s'il pourrait y avoir un choix l\u00e0-dedans. Donc \u00e7a, c'est vraiment un des obstacles principaux.\n[00:24:04 - 00:24:05] Olivia Boutay : Je ne sais pas si c'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s clair.\n[00:24:05 - 00:24:29] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Oui, oui, oui. Je m'en parlais avec les vergers d'\u00c9picure ce matin, parce qu'elles me disaient que c'\u00e9tait quand m\u00eame une coop\u00e9rative qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9... \u00e0 la base imagin\u00e9 pour une centaine de personnes et qui sont 18 et que c'est hyper compliqu\u00e9 d'avoir de l'engagement et puis qu'il faut communiquer, communiquer, mais que c'est jamais assez, c'est un vrai probl\u00e8me. Donc oui, c'est une difficult\u00e9 qui revient.\n[00:24:29 - 00:25:52] Olivia Boutay : C'est vrai que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la ferme, on a aussi cette question de l'engagement des gens et du fait de rencontrer finalement. C'est vrai qu'on se donne cette vocation de rencontrer, faire des choses avec les gens et puis sur papier c'est joli quand on en parle avec les gens et ils trouvent \u00e7a super. Puis apr\u00e8s quand on organise un atelier ou quelque chose, des fois on a 20 personnes, 25, on est content, puis des fois on en a 3. Et puis voil\u00e0, des fois \u00e7a tient \u00e0 tr\u00e8s peu de choses en fait. Et c'est vrai qu'il faut faire un travail, on est tellement inond\u00e9 d'informations tout le temps qu'il faut faire un travail de communication monstrueux pour obtenir trois clopinettes. Et puis c'est vrai que cette question de les gens sont venus habiter l\u00e0 pour un logement, il y a cet aspect de pression fonci\u00e8re \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve, avec le fait qu'il y a tr\u00e8s peu de logements disponibles, les gens vont habiter tr\u00e8s loin. Et donc un quartier comme \u00e7a qui se construit, c'est une manne, tout le monde s'est jet\u00e9 sur ses appartements. Et les gens, ils sont venus l\u00e0, ils ont achet\u00e9, ils ont trouv\u00e9 en location, etc. Pas du tout parce que c'est un \u00e9co-quartier, parce qu'il y avait des projets alimentaires ou d'autres projets chouettes l\u00e0-dedans. Ils sont venus l\u00e0 parce qu'il y avait un logement disponible. Et puis apr\u00e8s, il faut les acqu\u00e9rir \u00e0 notre cause, il faut leur faire conna\u00eetre, il faut essayer de les convaincre que c'est chouette ce qu'on fait et que \u00e7a peut-\u00eatre, \u00e7a vaut la peine.\n[00:25:54 - 00:25:58] Sabine Bally : Oui, puis que \u00e7a devienne leur cause. Et en fait, ce pas-l\u00e0... Oui, il.\n[00:25:58 - 00:26:19] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Y a beaucoup d'\u00e9tapes. Et oui, du coup, on parlait d'ateliers. Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres activit\u00e9s que la FED propose dont on n'a pas parl\u00e9 ? C'est principalement du coup tout ce qui est contractuel, plus de la vente en.\n[00:26:19 - 00:27:03] Sabine Bally : Direct \u00e0 la boutique, c'est \u00e7a ? Donc les membres sont invit\u00e9s \u00e0 participer au fonctionnement du magasin, c'est participatif. Et donc il y a ce qu'on appelle le shift ou le cr\u00e9neau. Donc ils travaillent dans le magasin, mais \u00e7a, \u00e7a peut prendre plein de formes diff\u00e9rentes. \u00c7a peut aussi avoir lieu \u00e0 la ferme, mais \u00e7a peut avoir lieu \u00e0 la fromagerie o\u00f9 ils peuvent aller chercher le lait. \u00c7a peut... se passer dans les groupes de travail, dans les groupes de r\u00e9flexion, dans les groupes de choix produits, etc. Donc il y a des gens qui vont, je sais pas, chercher les poulets \u00e0 la ferme o\u00f9 on les ach\u00e8te, ou les agrumes en hiver. Donc \u00e7a prend plein plein de formes diff\u00e9rentes.\n[00:27:03 - 00:27:21] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord, ok. Et est-ce que d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 comme de l'autre, il y a eu des \u00e9tapes un peu cl\u00e9s de l'\u00e9volution des projets ? Ouais, des moments importants. C'est vrai que normalement, je dois faire deux entretiens diff\u00e9rents pour chaque initiative. Du coup, il faut que je vous pose \u00e0 chaque fois... Oui, je pense.\n[00:27:21 - 00:28:26] Olivia Boutay : Qu'On peut les mettre aussi un petit peu ensemble parce qu'ils sont compl\u00e8tement conflits. Il y a ce fameux forum, je pense que c'est vraiment un peu l\u00e0 que les choses se sont mises en place. En tout cas, que les id\u00e9es se sont mises ensemble. Et puis, c'est \u00e0 partir de l\u00e0 qu'il y a des esp\u00e8ces de groupes qui ont \u00e9merg\u00e9, qui ont ensuite d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 sur des projets. Ensuite, je pense qu'on peut parler de l'ouverture de la Minifev. \u00c7a, c'\u00e9tait 2018, je crois. Et puis l\u00e0, le quartier existait \u00e0 peine. Les premiers habitants, ils sont arriv\u00e9s en 2015, mai 2015, je crois. Donc, il n'y avait que la moiti\u00e9 du quartier qui \u00e9tait construit. C'\u00e9tait encore tr\u00e8s complexe. Apr\u00e8s, d\u00e9but 2019, la ferme qui \u00e9tait qui a remport\u00e9 l'appel \u00e0 candidature et puis qui a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler sur le quartier, qui a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 cultiver aussi, devant la mini f\u00e8ve d'ailleurs, la premi\u00e8re parcelle. Au d\u00e9but c'\u00e9tait 300 m\u00b2, on a fait que des salades sur une ann\u00e9e. Et apr\u00e8s il y a la moyenne.\n[00:28:26 - 00:29:47] Sabine Bally : F\u00e8ve qui est ouverte... Ouais, fin 2020. Et en fait je pense que les \u00e9tapes o\u00f9 tu veux terminer toi... Non, non, vas-y. Moi, j'ai l'impression que pour la f\u00e8ve, les \u00e9tapes apr\u00e8s ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 l'ouverture du petit magasin, le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, et apr\u00e8s, lentement, c'est des petites \u00e9tapes dans un processus dans lequel on se trouve encore et qui sont \u00e0 chaque fois des r\u00e9flexions sur comment on quitte le magasin. La premi\u00e8re, c'est peut-\u00eatre la cr\u00e9ation des comptes magasins. c'est-\u00e0-dire de trouver un syst\u00e8me contractuel pour une somme fixe \u00e0 d\u00e9penser par mois dans le magasin. Donc on recherche en fait une fid\u00e9lisation, \u00e7a c'est l'abo Nectar et puis apr\u00e8s les comptes localis. Apr\u00e8s on a en 2023, on a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des paniers parce qu'en fait on souffrait de manque de d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s. Donc on a \u00e7a et puis Maintenant, aujourd'hui, on a le projet de caisse alimentaire qui va \u00eatre lanc\u00e9 en septembre 2025. \u00c7a, \u00e7a va \u00eatre un nouveau... Et puis apr\u00e8s, la cr\u00e9ation de la Grande F\u00e8ve, qui est pr\u00e9vue pour 2028-2030. Mais \u00e7a, c'est un peu \u00e0 venir. \u2014 C'est un agrandissement du site \u00e0 chaque fois. \u2014 Oui.\n[00:29:47 - 00:29:47] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Ouais.\n[00:29:47 - 00:30:03] Sabine Bally : Exactement. Et je pense quand m\u00eame l'\u00e9volution un peu des collectivit\u00e9s, le travail avec les collectivit\u00e9s publiques et priv\u00e9es, et puis la cr\u00e9ation en avril 2024, l'ouverture de la l\u00e9gumerie, qui vient vraiment sceller en fait.\n[00:30:03 - 00:30:16] Olivia Boutay : L'ouverture de la l\u00e9gumerie, et puis pour nous il y a encore l'entr\u00e9e dans la ferme ici. Donc c'est un b\u00e2timent qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9nov\u00e9 par la commune, qui appartient \u00e0 la commune, qui est une ancienne ferme, et dans laquelle on est rentr\u00e9 en juin 21.\n[00:30:16 - 00:30:17] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord, ok.\n[00:30:17 - 00:30:17] Olivia Boutay : Pas tout de suite.\n[00:30:21 - 00:30:42] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Par exemple, la production de la ferme va en brut \u00e0 la FEV et ensuite tout ce qui est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 l'atelier va par exemple \u00e0 des \u00e9coles et \u00e0 d'autres acteurs. Est-ce que parmi ces \u00e9tapes, il y a eu des grands changements dans l'histoire.\n[00:30:42 - 00:32:07] Olivia Boutay : De l'initiative comme de l'autre ? Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la ferme, je ne dirais pas D\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 \u00e7a s'est mis en place, on a quand m\u00eame eu une ligne. D'ailleurs, on avait fait nos objectifs \u00e0 5 ans quand on a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler l\u00e0. Et puis, on se rend compte qu'on est assez encore l\u00e0-dedans. On avait une vision suffisamment claire de l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on voulait aller. Alors \u00e9videmment qu'il y a des petits changements, on voulait augmenter beaucoup plus vite les animaux, ce qu'on n'a pas encore r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire, etc. Mais \u00e7a reste quand m\u00eame une ligne directrice qui reste d'actualit\u00e9. avec la volont\u00e9 aussi de devenir vraiment une ferme, d'augmenter nos surfaces. On commence \u00e0 trouver deux, trois petits coins qui sont tr\u00e8s petits, mais on a quand m\u00eame aussi des perspectives l\u00e0 qui sont en train de se cr\u00e9er. Donc, moi, j'ai l'impression qu'on travaille quand m\u00eame sur une ligne qui reste globalement la m\u00eame. La grosse r\u00e9volution, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 la transformation de l'aiguille. La l\u00e9gumerie, parce que \u00e7a, on n'avait pas du tout pr\u00e9vu. \u00c0 la base, on avait vraiment cette volont\u00e9 de travailler avec les collectivit\u00e9s publiques. Mais l'id\u00e9e, c'\u00e9tait, on a notre channel de distribution qui est la FEV. Et puis, la FEV s'occupe de vendre, y compris aux collectivit\u00e9s publiques. Et puis, en fait, assez vite, on s'est rendu compte que l\u00e0, \u00e7a bloquait, qu'on n'allait pas y arriver comme on l'avait imagin\u00e9, qu'il fallait cr\u00e9er autre chose.\n[00:32:07 - 00:32:24] Sabine Bally : Parce qu'en fait, ils n'ach\u00e8tent pas de l\u00e9gumes bruts, enfin, les collectivit\u00e9s publiques. De toute fa\u00e7on, ce sont des march\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9municipalis\u00e9s, et puis ce sont des prestataires priv\u00e9s qui n'ont pas le temps de payer leurs employ\u00e9s pour laver des l\u00e9gumes.\n[00:32:24 - 00:32:59] Olivia Boutay : Mais je dirais que m\u00eame l\u00e0-dedans, du point de vue de la ferme, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu un changement de vision par rapport aux l\u00e9gumes, mais on avait \u00e0 la base la volont\u00e9 de faire de la transformation. C'est vrai qu'on imaginait plut\u00f4t les conserves de fruits, parce qu'il y a beaucoup de vergers dans le quartier, o\u00f9 on avait parl\u00e9 d'avoir un pressoir \u00e0 huile. Il y avait un peu ces questions-l\u00e0, faire de la cuisson, etc. Et puis, finalement, cette envie de transformation, elle s'est un peu mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9e dans les l\u00e9gumes avec cette probl\u00e9matique qu'on a rencontr\u00e9e. Mais \u00e7a reste quand m\u00eame un objectif.\n[00:32:59 - 00:33:04] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : De base du projet. Et aujourd'hui c'est principalement la d\u00e9coupe de l\u00e9gumes ou du coup vous avez d'autres types de transformations ?\n[00:33:04 - 00:33:26] Olivia Boutay : Non c'est la seule, on fait un petit peu de choucroute, on fait un petit peu de lactofermentation, si on a des surplus de tomates on fait de la sauce tomate, mais c'est tr\u00e8s marginal comme transformation. Et vous travaillez avec combien d'\u00e9coles aujourd'hui ? On travaille avec trois cuisines, en fait c'est l'ensemble des \u00e9coles primaires de M\u00e9run, \u00e7a c'est une cuisine et puis on a deux cuisines de cr\u00e8che.\n[00:33:29 - 00:33:38] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Et on a commenc\u00e9, vous avez commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler du coup des projets d'avenir, d'extension, d'avoir plus d'animaux. Je veux bien qu'on d\u00e9veloppe un petit peu, puisqu'on y est, vos projets, vos perspectives pour un projet comme notre.\n[00:33:38 - 00:33:41] Olivia Boutay : Tu veux y aller ?\n[00:33:41 - 00:33:42] Sabine Bally : Vas-y.\n[00:33:42 - 00:34:18] Olivia Boutay : Alors pour nous, les perspectives, c'est en fait d'\u00e9quilibrer un petit peu le ratio entre l'entretien et l'agricole. Parce qu'actuellement, et en termes de temps de travail et en termes de chiffre d'affaires, clairement l'entretien il a plus de place. Et c'est pas notre volont\u00e9, notre volont\u00e9 c'est vraiment d'\u00eatre une ferme, de produire, mais pour \u00e7a il faut des surfaces. Donc jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant on produit avec les surfaces qu'on a, et puis depuis cette ann\u00e9e on a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre beaucoup plus proactifs dans la recherche de surfaces suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[00:34:18 - 00:34:19] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Donc vous dites l'entretien, c'est l'entretien du.\n[00:34:19 - 00:34:20] Olivia Boutay : Coup des surfaces ?\n[00:34:20 - 00:34:21] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Entretien paysager.\n[00:34:21 - 00:34:22] Sabine Bally : D'accord, enfin du quartier.\n[00:34:22 - 00:34:37] Olivia Boutay : D'accord. Voil\u00e0, et on est en train de trouver des surfaces, on esp\u00e8re des plus grosses surfaces l\u00e0 cet hiver. Donc voil\u00e0, \u00e7a c'est vraiment une perspective pour nous qui est importante.\n[00:34:37 - 00:34:38] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Alors.\n[00:34:40 - 00:36:06] Olivia Boutay : On a d\u00e9j\u00e0 les poules, mais on aimerait bien augmenter, faire peut-\u00eatre du poulet de chair aussi pour \u00eatre, comment dire, compl\u00e9mentaire avec les autres fermes avec qui on travaille justement, parce qu'il y a plusieurs fermes qui font des oeufs, notamment une ferme qui fait des oeufs. Mais maintenant, quand on est labellis\u00e9 BO Suisse, si on ach\u00e8te des poulettes, on doit aussi acheter des poulets. \u00c7a implique aussi un travail d'engraissement, etc. On a fait un peu des tests sur deux ans et \u00e7a fonctionne assez bien chez nous. Mais pour \u00e7a, on a besoin de surface. Donc il y aurait \u00e7a. Il y a aussi la volont\u00e9 d'avoir quelques cochons, pas beaucoup, mais quelques cochons, parce que comme il y a la fromagerie dans le quartier, \u00e7a veut dire petit lait. On a aussi des d\u00e9chets de l\u00e9gumes, surtout si on commence \u00e0 produire plus. Donc l\u00e0, \u00e7a serait une synergie assez int\u00e9ressante de valoriser tout \u00e7a avec des cochons. Voil\u00e0, pour le moment, c'est principalement \u00e7a. Et puis on a un coll\u00e8gue, un de nos employ\u00e9s qui travaille aussi, qui a une ferme en dehors, qui est aussi d'ailleurs un des fournisseurs de la f\u00e8ve, et qui a des moutons, qui d\u00e9veloppe actuellement un grand troupeau de moutons. et puis on aimerait bien d\u00e9velopper en collaboration avec lui l'\u00e9copature dans la commune avec justement la cr\u00e9ation d'un petit troupeau de moutons communal qui pourrait aller faire de l'\u00e9copature un petit peu en dehors du quartier aussi.\n[00:36:06 - 00:36:07] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord, ok.\n[00:36:07 - 00:36:08] Olivia Boutay : Voil\u00e0, \u00e7a c'est les animaux.\n[00:36:08 - 00:36:15] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Et l\u00e0 les poules par exemple, vous produisez des oeufs, vous vendez la f\u00e8ve j'imagine ?\n[00:36:15 - 00:36:36] Olivia Boutay : Non, pour le moment on a un tout petit march\u00e9 qu'on fait le lundi et pour le moment \u00e7a suffit quasiment bient\u00f4t plus, pour laisser comme d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s, parce que c'est tout tout petit, m\u00eame pas une vingtaine de par jours. Mais effectivement, si on a grandi, oui, oui, \u00e7a sera certainement valoris\u00e9 \u00e0 travers la FEB.\n[00:36:36 - 00:36:37] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Vous avez aussi un petit march\u00e9 ?\n[00:36:37 - 00:36:50] Olivia Boutay : Non, c'est vrai, on ne l'a pas dit parce que c'est tr\u00e8s petit. \u00c7a fait un an et demi, je pense, qu'on a ouvert un petit march\u00e9 l\u00e0 devant la ferme pour avoir aussi un contact privil\u00e9gi\u00e9, les contacts en direct.\n[00:36:51 - 00:36:52] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Plus proche avec les habitants.\n[00:36:52 - 00:37:08] Olivia Boutay : Avec les habitants et puis rencontrer d'autres personnes aussi. D'ailleurs, on fait beaucoup de pub pour la f\u00e8ve depuis notre petit march\u00e9. Comme on est \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'h\u00f4pital La Tour, \u00e7a permet d'avoir des gens qui n'iraient pas forc\u00e9ment au milieu du quartier faire leurs achats, mais qui passent.\n[00:37:08 - 00:37:10] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Par ici et qui ensuite peuvent se rendre \u00e0 la f\u00e8ve.\n[00:37:11 - 00:37:13] Olivia Boutay : Id\u00e9alement.\n[00:37:13 - 00:37:23] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Et donc votre production va aux \u00e9tablissements publics, \u00e0 la FEV, marginalement sur le petit march\u00e9, est-ce qu'il y a d'autres acteurs qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de la production ?\n[00:37:23 - 00:37:25] Olivia Boutay : Non, globalement c'est \u00e7a.\n[00:37:25 - 00:37:26] Sabine Bally : On travaille avec un...\n[00:37:26 - 00:37:27] Olivia Boutay : Comment ?\n[00:37:27 - 00:37:28] Sabine Bally : Ah, les paniers.\n[00:37:28 - 00:37:29] Olivia Boutay : Nous on fait pas de paniers.\n[00:37:29 - 00:37:31] Sabine Bally : Non, mais les paniers de la FEV.\n[00:37:31 - 00:38:29] Olivia Boutay : Oui, alors les paniers de la FEV, mais pour nous \u00e7a part \u00e0 la FEV. et puis on travaille avec un ou deux restaurants parce que historiquement on a travaill\u00e9 avec eux mais c'est vraiment tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s marginal. Et puis je dirais encore juste une perspective, une esp\u00e8ce de deadline qui approche gentiment c'est qu'on a un contrat d'entretien avec la commune sur dix ans et l\u00e0 on est d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus de la moiti\u00e9 et donc on a cette \u00e9ch\u00e9ance qui va arriver dans quatre ans et qu'on anticipe d\u00e9j\u00e0 un petit peu pour voir si et comment \u00e7a va se renouveler ce contrat parce qu'\u00e9videmment, comme je vous le disais, en termes de ressources humaines, en termes de chiffre d'affaires, c'est un gros montant pour nous. Et donc, suivant comment c'est renouvel\u00e9, \u00e7a va aussi... Enfin, je dirais pas forc\u00e9ment notre p\u00e9rennit\u00e9, mais notre sch\u00e9ma de fonctionnement, pourrait beaucoup \u00e9voluer li\u00e9 \u00e0 ce contrat-l\u00e0.\n[00:38:29 - 00:38:41] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Justement, avant de passer aux perspectives de l'affaire, je veux bien qu'on d\u00e9veloppe un peu sur tout ce qui est... parce que du coup, on a parl\u00e9 des mod\u00e8les de gouvernance, mais qu'est-ce qu'il en est du coup du mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique, financier.\n[00:38:41 - 00:39:37] Olivia Boutay : Comment \u00e7a va fonctionner ? Alors \u00e0 l'affaire, on fonctionne sans subvention \u00e0 l'exploitation. On a touch\u00e9 pas mal de subventions \u00e0 l'investissement. On a eu de la chance d'avoir plusieurs fondations qui nous ont aid\u00e9s. On a aussi le canton de Gen\u00e8ve qui a mont\u00e9 en fait un projet agricole, un projet de d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9gional pour appuyer les fermes urbaines qui se cr\u00e9aient. Donc l\u00e0, on a re\u00e7u aussi l'affaire \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de subventions dans ce cadre-l\u00e0. Donc \u00e0 l'investissement, on a re\u00e7u des subventions, mais maintenant \u00e0 l'exploitation, on est compl\u00e8tement ind\u00e9pendant. Et puis nos sources de financement, donc c'est le contrat d'entretien, vis-\u00e0-vis de la commune. Donc on a un gros contrat \u00e0 10 ans avec la commune pour l'entretien paysager du quartier, donc \u00e7a fait beaucoup d'argent. Et aussi... C'est \u00e0 combien de pourcents \u00e0 peu.\n[00:39:37 - 00:39:40] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Pr\u00e8s de votre part de chiffre d'affaires totale ?\n[00:39:40 - 00:40:02] Olivia Boutay : Je dirais \u00e0 70%. Oui, d'accord. Oui, peut-\u00eatre pas tout \u00e0 fait. 60% je dirais pour l'entretien. Et puis dans le m\u00eame contrat, on a aussi une part de sensibilisation. Donc toutes les actions qu'on fait aupr\u00e8s du grand public, les visites qu'on organise, etc. On a la chance de pouvoir organiser des choses gratuites parce qu'on est pay\u00e9 par ailleurs. D'accord.\n[00:40:02 - 00:40:04] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : \u00c7a rend 60% ?\n[00:40:04 - 00:40:10] Olivia Boutay : C'est en plus. L\u00e0, on parle de 10, 15, 10%. Et les 40% restants, c'est la production ?\n[00:40:10 - 00:40:11] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Et les 40% restants, c'est je dirais.\n[00:40:11 - 00:40:58] Olivia Boutay : 20 \u00e0 30% la production. Donc la vente de nos produits, notamment \u00e0 la f\u00e8ve, aux collectivit\u00e9s, etc. Via la l\u00e9gumerie, comme c'est tout nouveau la l\u00e9gumerie, je n'arrive pas \u00e0 faire une diff\u00e9renciation pour le moment. Et puis les derniers 10-15% qui restent, c'est aussi la sensibilisation, mais des prestations d'accueil de classe, en fait. On a deux partenariats, des partenariats avec deux associations, l'association \u00c9cole \u00e0 la Ferme, vous avez peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu parler. Non. En fait c'est une association qui vise simplement \u00e0 chercher les financements et qui paye ensuite les fermes qui accueillent les classes. \u00c7a permet de subventionner des visites de classes, mais nous on a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestation.\n[00:40:58 - 00:41:03] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : J'ai rencontr\u00e9 la Swiss Food Academy aussi, qui intervient pas mal au niveau des classes.\n[00:41:03 - 00:41:18] Olivia Boutay : Oui, mais ils interviennent dans les classes, alors que nous on accueille les classes \u00e0 la ferme. Et c'est vraiment notre... Enfin \u00e7a c'est quelque chose d'important pour nous, on nous a plusieurs fois demand\u00e9 de venir intervenir dans des classes Pour nous, ce n'est pas int\u00e9ressant en fait.\n[00:41:18 - 00:41:20] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Il faut qu'ils viennent voir...\n[00:41:20 - 00:41:38] Olivia Boutay : C'est-\u00e0-dire, nous, on n'est pas des p\u00e9dagogues, on est des producteurs. Et notre plus-value dans la formation et la transmission, c'est la ferme. Si les enfants ne viennent pas l\u00e0, ils peuvent se faire sensibiliser par d'autres personnes qui sont plus cal\u00e9es en, je ne sais pas, nutrition ou que sais-je.\n[00:41:38 - 00:41:41] Sabine Bally : Comme le Swiss Food Academy, je pense que c'est vraiment leur cr\u00e9neau.\n[00:41:43 - 00:42:08] Olivia Boutay : Et puis l'autre association avec laquelle on a un partenariat, c'est l'association Mater. C'est la maison de l'alimentation et du territoire qui s'est cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve il y a quelques ann\u00e9es. Et elle, elle a mont\u00e9 un mod\u00e8le d'atelier \u00e0 destination des \u00e9l\u00e8ves du secondaire. Et donc c'est des ateliers qu'on donne aussi dans diff\u00e9rentes fermes. Enfin, que nous on donne ici, mais que d'autres fermes donnent aussi. Et on est pay\u00e9 aussi \u00e0 la prestation pour ces ateliers-l\u00e0.\n[00:42:09 - 00:42:20] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Ok, super. Du coup, j'aime bien conna\u00eetre les perspectives de l'affaire, les projets \u00e9ventuels pour les prochaines ann\u00e9es.\n[00:42:21 - 00:42:25] Sabine Bally : C'est un peu ce que j'ai dit tout \u00e0 l'heure, donc il y a cette perspective d'avoir un... Voil\u00e0.\n[00:42:25 - 00:42:28] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Parce qu'il y a d'autres choses, par exemple, qu'on n'aurait pas encore \u00e9voqu\u00e9es.\n[00:42:28 - 00:42:31] Olivia Boutay : La caisse alimentaire, quand m\u00eame. Ouais.\n[00:42:31 - 00:45:47] Sabine Bally : Donc la caisse alimentaire, elle est port\u00e9e par six associations, dont la fili\u00e8re alimentaire des bergers. Et il y a... un peu le m\u00eame objectif finalement que celui du projet alimentaire de quartier, c'est de f\u00e9d\u00e9rer la production en amont. Et on retrouve cette m\u00eame volont\u00e9 dans le projet de caisse alimentaire par rapport \u00e0 la production territoriale, et de l'aborder en fait de mani\u00e8re syst\u00e9mique, et de dire bon ben, il y a un probl\u00e8me d'accessibilit\u00e9, donc la caisse elle r\u00e9pond plus que le magasin, puisque le magasin n'y r\u00e9pond pas du tout, \u00e0 cette question d'accessibilit\u00e9. Mais, en fait, le volet structuration de l'offre, cr\u00e9ation des fili\u00e8res, renforcement des fili\u00e8res, travail en commun au niveau de la production et de la transformation, ce volet-l\u00e0, il existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans le projet alimentaire et il trouve sa continuit\u00e9 dans le projet de caisse alimentaire. Donc, c'est la suite assez logique de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 avec le projet de quartier. Donc, il y aurait \u00e7a. Mais je pense que pour nous, la perspective, c'est difficile de mettre des mots dessus, mais c'est vraiment une recherche de se dire, comment on peut trouver un moyen pour que le projet devienne un projet dont les habitants s'emparent ? Et quel est ce travail ? Comment on peut arriver \u00e0 \u00e7a ? Comment, r\u00e9ellement, la fromagerie du quartier, on sort de l'anecdotique ? la personne qui va chercher le lait elle-m\u00eame, elle comprend en fait qu'il y a quelque chose d'autre que juste, c'est sympa de faire un voyage et puis de voir un vach\u00e9. Et \u00e7a pour moi, si on y arrive, c'est vraiment, c'est \u00e7a la r\u00e9ussite du projet. Et c'est pas un chiffre d'affaires plus, enfin c'est annexe finalement. Mais c'est de travailler \u00e0 \u00e7a. Et probablement avec le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement du magasin qui sera plus dans le quartier, \u00e7a se posera \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle de la commune. Et peut-\u00eatre que pour un projet comme \u00e7a, \u00e7a va \u00eatre une forme mixte. En tout cas, on n'a pas r\u00e9ussi aujourd'hui \u00e0 faire en sorte que ce soit un projet de quartier. Et donc on a ce terreau de base, et puis il va \u00eatre extrait de l\u00e0, et c'est un peu \u00e0 voir ce qui va se passer. Est-ce que \u00e7a sera quand m\u00eame un petit p\u00f4le d'information, ce magasin, s'il reste ? Est-ce que \u00e7a va \u00eatre un... magasins exclusivement fili\u00e8re courte avec ce qui est produit dans le quartier et transform\u00e9 dans le quartier, \u00e7a on sait pas encore. J'arrive pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re aussi claire que la ferme parce que je pense que c'est vraiment des choses auxquelles on est en train de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir encore aujourd'hui. et qui sont en gestation et en fait on ne peut pas, je pense qu'on ne peut pas r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la m\u00eame erreur, c'est-\u00e0-dire que la r\u00e9ponse elle ne va pas \u00eatre th\u00e9orique, elle doit \u00eatre port\u00e9e par les gens parce que sinon c'est un \u00e9chec, enfin un faux. Et \u00e7a je sais pas comment \u00e7a va se faire mais je pense que c'est pas impossible. Mais c'est vraiment cette notion que j'ai \u00e9voqu\u00e9e tout \u00e0 l'heure de commun. Je pense que le commun il est d\u00e9fini par une pratique en commun Et en fait, si on arrive \u00e0 faire \u00e7a, \u00e7a serait \u00e7a.\n[00:45:47 - 00:45:49] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Cette pratique n'a pas encore pris vraiment forme. Non.\n[00:45:49 - 00:45:55] Sabine Bally : Et puis en fait, on n'a pas les formes, on n'a pas les mots pour r\u00e9ellement...\n[00:45:55 - 00:46:06] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : On ne sait pas encore quoi. Et du coup, oui, peut-\u00eatre aussi, si vous pouviez m'expliciter comment fonctionne votre mod\u00e8le financier, \u00e9conomique, sur quoi \u00e7a repose.\n[00:46:06 - 00:46:29] Sabine Bally : Oui, alors nous, on n'a pas non plus de subvention fixe. Il y a eu aussi des soutiens pour l'investissement. Et aujourd'hui, il y a les entr\u00e9es par les ventes du magasin, les ventes des paniers. Et puis... \u2014 Je veux bien que.\n[00:46:29 - 00:46:31] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Vous me sp\u00e9cifiez \u00e0 chaque fois \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s combien de.\n[00:46:38 - 00:47:23] Sabine Bally : Je dirais peut-\u00eatre 80% vente magasin, 10% panier et 10% prestation externe qui comprend un mixte de projets sp\u00e9cifiques, on a des projets de, je sais pas, panier solidaire par exemple, qui pr\u00e9figure aussi un peu le travail qu'on veut faire avec la classe alimentaire. On rentre d\u00e9j\u00e0 en contact avec des nouveaux publics et du coup on a des subventions pour faire \u00e7a, donc en fait \u00e7a nous paye un d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire, plus un travail un peu de coh\u00e9sion sociale. Donc je pense \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, \u00e7a doit \u00eatre \u00e7a, \u00e7a doit \u00eatre 10%, 10%. On a 150 000, 150 000, 800 000. \u00c0 peu pr\u00e8s, je dirais.\n[00:47:23 - 00:47:33] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord. Dans quelle mesure est-ce que vous diriez, pour chaque initiative, que vous contribuez \u00e0 un effort de transition alimentaire ?\n[00:47:33 - 00:47:35] Olivia Boutay : Je pense que c'est assez clair, oui.\n[00:47:35 - 00:47:40] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Non, non, c'est pas \u00e9vident, mais c'est pour pouvoir avoir l'explicitation.\n[00:47:40 - 00:48:47] Olivia Boutay : Dans quelle mesure ? Parce qu'on cherche vraiment \u00e0 faire diff\u00e9remment. On cherche justement \u00e0 responsabiliser les gens, on cherche \u00e0 les impliquer. On cherche aussi \u00e0 produire. On est de la Belize Bio, mais on cherche \u00e0 aller un petit peu plus loin. Et puis, par rapport aux producteurs, il y a ce fait de se mettre ensemble et de d\u00e9cider ensemble, alors pas de la mani\u00e8re dont on produit, puisque \u00e7a, on a chacun nos sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s, mais d'\u00eatre solidaires vis-\u00e0-vis d'un magasin. et puis de ne pas se faire de concurrence, de se mettre d'accord sur des prix, de se mettre d'accord sur une mani\u00e8re de fonctionner, ce qui nous demande \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'efforts en fait, mais aussi des garanties qu'on va pouvoir vendre une certaine quantit\u00e9 et puis le fait, quand m\u00eame je dirais, le sentiment d'accomplissement d'arriver \u00e0 faire quelque chose ensemble au lieu de se tirer dans les pattes.\n[00:48:48 - 00:50:33] Sabine Bally : Et pour la France ? Bon bah d\u00e9j\u00e0, je monte dans ce sens-l\u00e0 et je pense que l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on est vraiment, on se d\u00e9marque un peu, je crois que c'est vraiment d'essayer de sortir de la logique de consommation et pas juste proposer une alternative \u00e0 travers l'acte d'achat, mais en faire en fait un changement soci\u00e9tal. C'est \u00e7a qui me c'est que l\u00e0 que \u00e7a peut avoir un r\u00e9el impact. Apr\u00e8s, dans le projet tel qu'il existe, nos premiers quartiers agro-\u00e9cologiques de Suisse, qui n'est pas seulement \u00e9cologique en termes d'habitation, mais vraiment aussi qui inclut l'alimentation l\u00e0-dedans, moi je trouve que quand on fait des visites, on remarque si on vit dans un immeuble o\u00f9 il y a un fromager qui travaille, En fait, il se trouve qu'on sait quand il a travaill\u00e9 parce qu'il y a une odeur. Et cette exp\u00e9rience sensible, pour moi, elle est hyper importante. Et c'est une dimension qu'on ne valorise pas tant que \u00e7a. Mais finalement, \u00e7a veut dire qu'il y a un r\u00e9el impact. De savoir que quand c'est le jour de production du fromager parce que \u00e7a sent, ou alors on voit les moutons, il y a toute une dimension sensible qui est donn\u00e9e dans ce quartier. et qui va bien au-del\u00e0 du fait de pouvoir acheter une carotte qui a des valeurs nutritives plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es parce qu'en fait, elle est produite de mani\u00e8re agro\u00e9cologique. Et \u00e7a, je trouve que c'est quelque chose d'inestimable, en fait. Et d'assez important. Enfin, qui fait partie de ce qu'on propose.\n[00:50:33 - 00:50:56] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Oui. Et justement, par rapport \u00e0 ce que vous disiez avec le fromager, je ne sais plus qui m'a dit qu'en Suisse, il y avait un projet d'utiliser tous les rez-de-chauss\u00e9e pouvoir y mettre un artisan ou des plantes ou quelque chose qui soit en lien avec l'alimentation. \u00c7a m'a fait penser \u00e0 \u00e7a.\n[00:50:56 - 00:51:47] Sabine Bally : Non, il y a un projet qui s'appelle R\u00e9actif, qui est port\u00e9 par la Chambre de l'\u00e9conomie sociale et solidaire. Et effectivement, en fait, dans beaucoup de quartiers, il y a un probl\u00e8me avec ces surfaces en rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, parce que c'est ces surfaces-l\u00e0 qui am\u00e8nent la vie et le lien social dans les quartiers. mais souvent elles sont d\u00e9sert\u00e9es puisqu'elles sont trop ch\u00e8res et donc eux ils misent sur un accompagnement entrepreneurial pour des entreprises qui seraient int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et un accompagnement un peu plus logistique par rapport aux bailleurs et tout \u00e7a de dire mais \u00e7a vaut la peine d'investir donc de par exemple de baisser les loyers pour avoir quelqu'un dans cet espace parce qu'en fait ils vous apportent beaucoup et des choses qui se traduisent pas forc\u00e9ment en argent en termes de loyers. Donc eux, c'est la chambre de l'\u00e9conomie sociale, c'est apr\u00e8s. Donc ils travaillent l\u00e0-dessus.\n[00:51:49 - 00:52:32] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Alors avant qu'on passe aux questions, \u00e7a passe tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s vite, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 45. J'ai deux derni\u00e8res questions, apr\u00e8s on pourra passer aux petites vid\u00e9os. Du coup, c'est vrai que tout au long de l'entretien, on a parl\u00e9 de beaucoup d'acteurs dont vous \u00eates entour\u00e9s, avec lesquels il y a des synergies, \u00e7a semble assez clair \u00e9videmment dans l'\u00e9co-quartier, avec les autres faits, vous fonctionnez vous-m\u00eame en r\u00e9seau. Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres secteurs, d'autres acteurs avec qui vous avez des \u00e9changes, que ce soit des \u00e9changes de savoir-faire ou mat\u00e9riel, enfin, si on peut cartographier un peu le r\u00e9seau auquel vous appartenez, les diff\u00e9rents univers, et puis \u00e0 chaque fois peut-\u00eatre me sp\u00e9cifier qu'est-ce que \u00e7a vous apporte \u00e0 vous et qu'est-ce que \u00e7a leur apporte \u00e0 eux, m\u00eame si \u00e7a parait \u00e9vident, peut-\u00eatre. Je veux bien qu'on explicite un peu tout \u00e7a.\n[00:52:33 - 00:53:46] Olivia Boutay : Oui, bah du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la ferme, Je dirais, on a les deux personnes qui sont en charge maintenant plut\u00f4t des cultures. Elles ont suivi une formation qui s'appelle Microferme. Je sais pas si vous avez entendu parler. C'est une toute nouvelle formation qui a trois ans, je crois, d'existence. Et donc, ils l'ont suivi \u00e0 une ann\u00e9e d'intervalle chacun. Donc \u00e7a, \u00e7a a vraiment permis de cr\u00e9er un r\u00e9seau. C'est un r\u00e9seau maintenant qu'eux, ils entretiennent, qu'ils ont... qu'il leur permet d'aller tout d'un coup aller poser une question sur un mode de culture, sur un probl\u00e8me qu'ils rencontrent, etc. Je sais qu'il y a beaucoup d'\u00e9changes l\u00e0 autour et donc eux contribuent aussi \u00e9videmment \u00e0 ces \u00e9changes l\u00e0. \u00c7a c'est au niveau de la production. On a eu des \u00e9changes aussi parce qu'on a des \u00e2nes et on fait de l'attraction animale dans nos cultures. Donc on a eu des \u00e9changes avec diff\u00e9rentes fermes qui travaillent de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re ici \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve. Une des fermes du r\u00e9seau travaille aussi avec des \u00e2nes, donc on est all\u00e9 les voir, on a un petit peu discut\u00e9. Et puis maintenant, on est beaucoup en relation avec une autre ferme qui travaille avec un cheval.\n[00:53:46 - 00:53:46] Sabine Bally : Eux.\n[00:53:49 - 00:54:25] Olivia Boutay : Ils ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 une association. On est en train de voir si on entrerait dans cette association. Donc il y a des \u00e9changes qui se font l\u00e0 autour. Sinon, on travaille aussi avec l'atelier paysan. que vous devez conna\u00eetre, je pense, parce que c'est une initiative plut\u00f4t fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la base. Donc c'est des paysans qui se sont mis ensemble pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 plus transformer eux-m\u00eames leurs outils, voire les fabriquer \u00e0 partir de z\u00e9ro. Donc des outils adapt\u00e9s au type de culture, \u00e0 ce qui est recherch\u00e9 au niveau de la pr\u00e9servation du sol, etc.\n[00:54:27 - 00:54:27] Sabine Bally : Et \u00e7a, on a un de nos.\n[00:54:27 - 00:54:57] Olivia Boutay : Coll\u00e8gues qui aime bien faire de la soudure, donc souvent, c'est lui qui va faire ce genre d'atelier et puis qui revient avec plein d'outils rigolos. Donc l\u00e0, on a aussi cette volont\u00e9 de peut-\u00eatre cr\u00e9er un petit groupe sur Gen\u00e8ve. C'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un petit peu le cas, mais de d\u00e9velopper ce groupe et puis d'en faire partie par rapport aux \u00e9changes de bons proc\u00e9d\u00e9s au niveau des outils. Je ne sais pas, qu'est-ce que j'oublie ? Qu'est-ce que tu veux rajouter toi ?\n[00:54:57 - 00:55:02] Sabine Bally : Peut-\u00eatre, ce qui me semble tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s important, c'est le lien avec les politiques publiques.\n[00:55:02 - 00:55:04] Olivia Boutay : Oui, alors \u00e9videmment, oui, je veux dire.\n[00:55:04 - 00:55:05] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : La communaut\u00e9, si tu veux avoir des.\n[00:55:05 - 00:55:56] Sabine Bally : Sujets... Ouais, mais vraiment, en fait, pour moi c'est un peu nouveau, parce qu'avant que je travaillais ici, je travaillais dans un autre... enfin, dans le cin\u00e9ma, et vraiment, en fait, pour moi, ces projets qui veulent sortir, enfin, qui ont l'ambition d'\u00eatre syst\u00e9miques et de proposer r\u00e9ellement quelque chose de diff\u00e9rent, ils ne peuvent pas se faire dans l'\u00e9conomie de march\u00e9. En fait, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, il faut regarder \u00e7a en face. Et nous, on a vraiment... En fait, je pense que ce projet, il est marqu\u00e9 par la commune de M\u00e9run. Donc, c'est le plus petit \u00e9chelon politique en Suisse. Il y a la commune, le canton et la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Et donc, la commune... Et nous, on est vraiment... M\u00e9run, cette commune qui a une grande zone industrielle, donc qui est relativement riche, peut se permettre... Enfin, c'est \u00e7a aussi. C'est que nous, on b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie compl\u00e8tement du soutien de cette ville dans laquelle on se trouve. Et donc le lien avec les politiques est tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s important, je trouve.\n[00:55:56 - 00:56:12] Olivia Boutay : Tr\u00e8s important, tr\u00e8s fort, oui, c'est vrai, j'aurais d\u00fb sortir \u00e7a en premier. Non, c'est s\u00fbr, dans tous nos projets, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en soutien. Ils sont toujours, et c'est continu depuis la cr\u00e9ation du quartier.\n[00:56:12 - 00:56:45] Sabine Bally : Et l\u00e0, m\u00eame pour la caisse alimentaire, donc ce projet prototype qui va commencer en septembre de l'ann\u00e9e prochaine, il y a une motion, il y a les \u00e9lus qui s'engagent, il y a vraiment la possibilit\u00e9 d'un dialogue, et c'est toujours un peu fastidieux, mais en m\u00eame temps \u00e7a ouvre, \u00e7a cr\u00e9e une adh\u00e9sion. Cette adh\u00e9sion qu'on a dit inexistante, mais en tout cas au niveau politique elle est l\u00e0, et il y a une volont\u00e9 politique d'exp\u00e9rimenter et d'aller dans cette direction. Donc \u00e7a je pense que c'est quand m\u00eame assez une chance.\n[00:56:45 - 00:57:26] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Oui, ce qui m'a l'air assez... Oui, par pour le coup en France, c'est en France. Au contraire, du fait que ce soit d'autant plus complexe aussi de par la taille du pays, vous avez une esp\u00e8ce de l\u00e9thargie tr\u00e8s importante aussi parce qu'il y a beaucoup de remaniement dans les politiques locales. des lieux qui changent, donc d'un coup les initiatives se retrouvent d\u00e9pourvues de subventions qu'elles touchaient il y a un an, donc en fait c'est hyper complexe. \u00c7a revient au fait qu'en Suisse il y a quand m\u00eame beaucoup de soutien des politiques. \u00c7a vient quand m\u00eame, d'apr\u00e8s ce que j'ai compris, des initiatives et hop, apr\u00e8s la l\u00e9gislation se fait \u00e0 partir de \u00e7a. \u00c7a vient pas trop...\n[00:57:28 - 00:57:45] Sabine Bally : Je pense que c'est aussi des personnes et c'est aussi des cultures de ville. Je pense que M\u00e9run est vraiment sp\u00e9cifique, a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 innovant. D\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es 60, en fait, ils ont cette vocation. Et m\u00eame si les \u00e9lus changent et tout \u00e7a, il y a un peu une tradition ici. Mais apr\u00e8s, c'est aussi des personnes.\n[00:57:45 - 00:58:28] Olivia Boutay : Mais effectivement, vous avez dit l'initiative vient de la population. Et \u00e7a, je pense que c'est important. En fait, parce qu'on voit que des initiatives qui seraient plut\u00f4t impos\u00e9es par le politique, en fait, c'est assez rare qu'elles prennent. Parce qu'il y a tout ce travail de convaincre, il faut que les gens s'approprient l'id\u00e9e, etc. Et m\u00eame si on a des fois l'impression qu'on n'arrive pas \u00e0 atteindre les gens, etc. En fait, il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 un noyau de personnes convaincues et convaincantes quand m\u00eame. Et puis qui vont aussi justement faire ce travail de convaincre les politiques publiques d'aller faire un petit peu de lobbying finalement.\n[00:58:28 - 00:58:28] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[00:58:28 - 00:58:36] Sabine Bally : Et peut-\u00eatre un autre acteur important et un peu sp\u00e9cifique, je pense, c'est les coop\u00e9ratives d'habitation.\n[00:58:37 - 00:58:37] Olivia Boutay : Oui.\n[00:58:37 - 00:58:51] Sabine Bally : Et notamment en termes d'alimentation, nous on peut faire des exp\u00e9rimentations parce qu'il y a ce terreau un peu fertile dans ce quartier donc il y a aussi 50% des 16 hectares de ce quartier qui appartenaient \u00e0 la commune.\n[00:58:51 - 00:58:52] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[00:58:52 - 00:59:45] Sabine Bally : Donc c'est aussi, l\u00e0 aussi on la trouve d\u00e9j\u00e0 la commune, mais du coup pour les exp\u00e9rimentations alimentaires et pour retrouver un engagement pour permettre \u00e0 des exp\u00e9rimentations comme les n\u00f4tres d'exister, Le lien avec les coop\u00e9ratives d'habitation, c'est pas mal. Puis apr\u00e8s, il y a quand m\u00eame, sp\u00e9cifiquement pour la FEV, nous, on s'engage un peu, et c'est important pour nous, d'\u00eatre en lien avec les autres magasins participatifs de Suisse, puisque je pense, ou de Suisse romande, l\u00e0, il y a un r\u00e9seau, il y en a 150. Je pense que c'est important de reconna\u00eetre que \u00e7a marque une insatisfaction par rapport \u00e0 la grande distribution. Les r\u00e9ponses, elles ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas toujours les justes ou p\u00e9rennes, mais en tout cas de s'allier et d'avancer ensemble avec ces initiatives qui partent du m\u00eame constat. Et \u00e7a, c'est assez important et puis voil\u00e0, on s'engage l\u00e0-dedans.\n[00:59:47 - 00:59:59] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Super, alors pour finir, je veux bien que, \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le, vous me donniez peut-\u00eatre les plus grandes forces et faiblesses de chaque initiative, et puis aussi les opportunit\u00e9s et menaces qui p\u00e8sent un peu sur ces deux projets.\n[01:00:02 - 01:01:02] Olivia Boutay : Bon, pour la ferme, je dirais qu'\u00e0 la fois c'est une force et une faiblesse, c'est ce mandat d'entretien, parce que \u00e7a nous am\u00e8ne une stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re qui est extr\u00eamement int\u00e9ressante. et puis un peu un fonds de commerce si je peux dire, aussi en termes d'activit\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire que c'est un mandat sur lequel on a de l'activit\u00e9 toute l'ann\u00e9e, contrairement \u00e0 des cultures o\u00f9 forc\u00e9ment il y a plus un creux pendant l'hiver, quoique avec nos tunnels un petit peu moins, mais quand m\u00eame \u00e7a nous garantit une stabilit\u00e9 en termes financiers, en termes d'occupation des \u00e9quipes. Mais c'est aussi une grosse faiblesse parce que \u00e7a veut dire que si un jour \u00e7a, \u00e7a tombe, il faudra revoir le mod\u00e8le compl\u00e8tement. Parce qu'actuellement, sans \u00e7a, avec notre mod\u00e8le actuel, on ne tournerait pas. Donc il y a \u00e7a. Vas-y, je peux passer la main, je r\u00e9fl\u00e9chis.\n[01:01:02 - 01:03:41] Sabine Bally : Donc je pense que nous, une des forces, mais c'est nous, le projet alimentaire, c'est qu'on h\u00e9rite d'un mouvement qui remonte en fait \u00e0 plus de 40 ans \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve, o\u00f9 c'est un mouvement de paysans qui sont engag\u00e9s dans des projets de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes. Donc il y a les ACP, enfin les AMAP, l'\u00e9quivalent des AMAP, dont la premi\u00e8re en Europe a vu le jour \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve. Et \u00e7a, \u00e7a a donn\u00e9, et c'est vraiment quelques personnes, principalement une, qui, depuis plus de 40 ans, r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit \u00e0 \u00e7a. Et donc nous, on h\u00e9rite de toute cette histoire. On n'est pas juste en train d'arriver et puis de faire quelque chose de nouveau. Donc on h\u00e9rite non seulement de cette histoire, mais on h\u00e9rite aussi de personnes qui se sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9es dans un mouvement qui nous pr\u00e9c\u00e8de. Donc \u00e7a, \u00e7a nous rend quand m\u00eame plus forts. d'exp\u00e9rimentation autour du contractuel. Donc \u00e7a, je pense que c'est une sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 et une force. Et que ces personnes sont encore l\u00e0 et qu'elles sont engag\u00e9es l\u00e0-dedans. Et peut-\u00eatre une autre opportunit\u00e9 ou force, c'est d'\u00eatre dans cette commune qui s'engage. Et qui a cette tradition l\u00e0 aussi, il y a un peu une histoire. Et puis en tout cas, Du nouveau pour le projet alimentaire dans sa globalit\u00e9, une des grandes menaces c'est quand m\u00eame la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation. La logique de consommation qui domine et aussi le danger de disparition possible de tous les moyens de production qu'on cherche co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte \u00e0 pr\u00e9server. On est dans un paysage totalement d\u00e9vast\u00e9 et parfois on oublie un peu que c'est le cas. Mais finalement, manger un \u0153uf d'une poule qui n'est pas une race hybride, je ne sais pas quoi, qui est comme 98,9% de tous les \u0153ufs de production mondiale, \u00e7a ne va pas du tout de soi. Et on n'est pas \u00e0 l'abri que \u00e7a nous \u00e9chappe compl\u00e8tement. Donc cette pression-l\u00e0 de la situation dans du contexte mondial en fait, mais aussi juste europ\u00e9en de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u00e9o-lib\u00e9rale. En plus, en Suisse, on est quand m\u00eame clairement l\u00e0-dedans. En Suisse et ailleurs aussi. Et la proximit\u00e9 avec la France, je pense qu'elle complexifie aussi en termes d'habitude d'achat, parce qu'il y a... De prix, oui.\n[01:03:41 - 01:03:49] Olivia Boutay : Parce qu'on est beaucoup, beaucoup plus cher que d'autres producteurs ici, et beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup plus cher que.\n[01:03:54 - 01:03:59] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres forces, faiblesses, opportunit\u00e9s, menaces ?\n[01:03:59 - 01:04:05] Olivia Boutay : Est-ce qu'on a fait le tour ?\n[01:04:05 - 01:04:06] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Juste une petite chose que je voulais.\n[01:04:06 - 01:04:06] Olivia Boutay : Vous demander du coup.\n[01:04:07 - 01:04:20] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : Est-ce que ce projet alimentaire, que ce soit la ferme ou la FEV, est-ce qu'il y a des mouvements ou des initiatives qui vous ont influenc\u00e9 et qui ont pouss\u00e9 un peu la naissance des projets ?\n[01:04:20 - 01:04:59] Sabine Bally : Pour la FEV, projet magasin qui est aujourd'hui, dont on se d\u00e9tourne un peu aujourd'hui. Il y a la Louvre \u00e0 Paris, et puis Food Cop \u00e0 Brooklyn, qui est une coop\u00e9rative qui date de la fin des ann\u00e9es 70 et qui a 17 000 membres. Et c'est vraiment, en fait, un cin\u00e9aste qui a fait un film sur ce projet-l\u00e0, qui venait de New York, qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 la Louvre, en fait. Donc il y a une vraie filiation entre ces deux projets. Et puis ici, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 vraiment Tom Booth, il s'appelle, Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vraiment tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sent et puis il cherche beaucoup \u00e0 soutenir les projets de magasins participatifs et tout \u00e7a.\n[01:04:59 - 01:05:00] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[01:05:00 - 01:05:02] Sabine Bally : Pour le magasin, c'\u00e9tait important.\n[01:05:02 - 01:06:07] Olivia Boutay : Et du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la ferme ? J'ai envie de dire qu'on a un peu cr\u00e9\u00e9 notre propre mod\u00e8le, mais c'est s\u00fbr qu'on s'est inspir\u00e9s de plein d'autres. En fait, Sabine parlait de l'agriculture contractuelle de proximit\u00e9. C'est s\u00fbr que \u00e7a fait partie un peu de notre ADN. On s'est beaucoup inspir\u00e9s de \u00e7a. On a cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette ferme, dans le groupe qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette ferme, il y avait d'autres producteurs, d'autres fermes, donc on a aussi imagin\u00e9 \u00e7a sur leur mod\u00e8le, finalement. Et puis je pensais \u00e0 un autre truc, je ne sais plus. Oui, toutes ces fermes qui sont presque en ville, finalement, qu'on appelle fermes urbaines. Il y en a une autre, c'est la ferme de Bud\u00e9, qui est encore plus en ville que nous, qui est au Petit Saconnet. qui a beaucoup ax\u00e9 son activit\u00e9 sur la vente parce qu'ils sont \u00e0 un endroit tr\u00e8s accessible et tr\u00e8s favorable pour la vente de produits locaux. Moi j'y ai travaill\u00e9, une de nos coll\u00e8gues aussi a travaill\u00e9 l\u00e0-bas donc c'est un mod\u00e8le qu'on connaissait et puis sur lequel on s'est aussi bas\u00e9.\n[01:06:07 - 01:06:08] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : D'accord.\n[01:06:08 - 01:06:12] Sabine Bally : Et il y a peut-\u00eatre le projet de Monsarto pour la lignumerie ou pas trop ?\n[01:06:13 - 01:06:19] Olivia Boutay : Si, oui tout \u00e0 fait. sur lequel on s'est, je dirais, un peu appuy\u00e9, mais je pense...\n[01:06:19 - 01:06:20] Sabine Bally : C'\u00e9tait pas une inspiration.\n[01:06:20 - 01:06:32] Olivia Boutay : On s'est pas bas\u00e9 sur leur fonctionnement pour cr\u00e9er la l\u00e9gumerie. Mais c'est s\u00fbr qu'on s'en est... C'\u00e9tait une source d'inspiration et puis on a utilis\u00e9 comme exemple pour montrer que c'\u00e9tait possible aussi. Oui, tout \u00e0 fait.\n[01:06:34 - 01:06:35] B\u00e9r\u00e9nice : J'irai voir tout \u00e7a.\n[01:06:36 - 01:06:37] Olivia Boutay : Merci beaucoup.\n"}, {"PROJECT": "DK-022", "YEAR": 2024, "MONTH": "May", "NAME": "Favrskov Municipality - Ulrich Remien Zickert", "DESCRIPTION": "Favrskov Municipality is a government entity near \u00c5rhus committed to sustainable action, specifically a sustainable food system.

We are investigating understanding how the food system in the municipality works. And specifically, we wanted to ask you a little bit about your lunch today. What lunch is usually like for you at the end of this. We also have a small consent form for you to sign so that we can use this information. Look over it, let us know. Do you mind if you spell your name for me in full? And your email.\n[00:00:35 - 00:00:50] Peter Karkov : Oh, well, it's Peter. I'm not sure how the English spell. P E, T E, R. Perfect. And then kakow. K, A R K A R, K O, V. K, O, E, V.\n[00:00:52 - 00:00:53] Nicole : Yeah, perfect.\n[00:00:53 - 00:00:55] Peter Karkov : Yes. And Jacobson.\n[00:00:55 - 00:00:59] Nicole : Jacobson.

Do you want to kick it off or you want me to.\n[00:01:18 - 00:01:20] Peter Karkov : Yeah. Okay.\n[00:01:20 - 00:01:25] Astrid : First, we would love to hear about your role in the municipality. Just quickly, what do you do?\n[00:01:26 - 00:01:48] Peter Karkov : I work with information security. So it's. Yeah, all the things. Firewalls. If the setup is correct, it's not the technical part. It's more the governance part I'm working with. So also, if there's a security break, we have to report it to the data till. Sheen. I don't know what it is in English.\n[00:01:48 - 00:01:54] Astrid : Me neither. The people who. Yeah. Security issues on a national basis kind of thing.\n[00:01:54 - 00:02:16] Peter Karkov : Yeah. And I'm also kind of a project manager for this different stuff we do. According to the information security, we also have a data scanner I'm implementing that's scanning for CPR and confidential information. So that's the gist of it, I think.\n[00:02:16 - 00:02:17] Nicole : Perfect. Nice.\n[00:02:17 - 00:02:23] Astrid : Okay, and now to the lunch. Okay, so what did you pick for lunch today?\n[00:02:23 - 00:02:29] Peter Karkov : Well, we can't pick lunch. We got the buffet, and then we can just take what's there.\n[00:02:29 - 00:02:29] Astrid : Yeah.\n[00:02:30 - 00:02:45] Peter Karkov : So there's the hot meal, or what do you call it? The hot dish. I had that, and then I took something from the salad bar. But it's a very limited assortment that's there, so there's not much to pick from. I don't know what you.\n[00:02:46 - 00:02:47] Astrid : I think that that's great.\n[00:02:47 - 00:02:47] Peter Karkov : Okay.\n[00:02:47 - 00:02:53] Astrid : Yeah. Talking us through your. Your choices when you. When you meet this setup. Yeah.\n[00:02:53 - 00:03:35] Peter Karkov : Okay. Well, when. Well, the hot dish, it's just there. And usually you Take it. Unless you're a vegetarian. And on Wednesday it is a vegetarian dish, the hot dish. So when you take that, you go to the buffet, the salat buffet, where there's also some, sometimes chicken, and then you pick out what you want. I stay clear of olives and tomatoes and things I don't like, but if I like some of the things, I take it, of course. And then we have the. What's it called? Dressing. Different kinds of dressing you can pour out over the salad. And then you also have the option to take some bread.\n[00:03:36 - 00:03:37] Astrid : Nice, great.\n[00:03:39 - 00:03:52] Nicole : So tell me a little bit about what your lunchtime rituals or habits are. Is there a process that you normally go through? Do you leave at the same time every day, sit in the same place?\n[00:03:52 - 00:03:59] Peter Karkov : Oh, sorry, it's the CO2 scanner. Because when we close the door and there's a lot of people in here.\n[00:03:59 - 00:04:01] Nicole : Oh, we're talking too much, eh?\n[00:04:01 - 00:04:07] Peter Karkov : No, just loves you too. Sorry again.\n[00:04:07 - 00:04:13] Nicole : That's okay. Just lunchtime habits and routines. Do you do the same thing every day? Change it up?\n[00:04:14 - 00:04:20] Peter Karkov : Yeah, half past eleven. Usually we go to lunch. So we get out there before everything is taken.\n[00:04:21 - 00:04:22] Nicole : Everyone in the office?\n[00:04:24 - 00:04:51] Peter Karkov : Yeah, Usually it depends on if you have meetings or anything, but we just go around to each other and eat lunch and the people who have the time and is hungry, we go out and take lunch. It's usually there. Some of the other your mother's co workers have different time slots where they can go eat. But it's more open for us up here. We don't have to contact with the users.\n[00:04:52 - 00:04:55] Nicole : I see, interesting. And how long do you take for lunch?\n[00:04:55 - 00:04:56] Peter Karkov : About half an hour.\n[00:04:56 - 00:05:00] Nicole : Half an hour. I see. Do you sit with the same people every day?\n[00:05:00 - 00:05:11] Peter Karkov : Well, again, it depends on who's there. Yeah, who's there who have meetings, is somebody working at home. So it differs a lot, but we always sit with the IT department.\n[00:05:11 - 00:05:12] Nicole : I see.\n[00:05:12 - 00:05:14] Peter Karkov : It's more or less the same people.\n[00:05:14 - 00:05:20] Nicole : And do you eat the lunch every day or do you occasionally bring in your lunch or go out to eat?\n[00:05:20 - 00:05:21] Peter Karkov : I eat every day.\n[00:05:21 - 00:05:22] Nicole : Eat every day.\n[00:05:23 - 00:05:28] Astrid : What would you say is the best thing about the lunch arrangement here?\n[00:05:28 - 00:05:50] Peter Karkov : Well, that it's pre made. I don't know if it's the correct word, but when you were starting you bring your own food. I don't want to do that, I'm lazy. And then I get some salad. I probably wouldn't do that if I had to make it myself. So because it's pre made or it's already there and you get a warm Meal, I just pay for it. It's easier, more convenient.\n[00:05:50 - 00:05:52] Astrid : Yeah, nice.\n[00:05:56 - 00:06:09] Nicole : Tell me a little bit about what you feel like you get out of this. It sounds like you don't have to prepare a meal. Are there any other benefits, do you think, to the lunch scheme? To you or to the office?\n[00:06:10 - 00:06:30] Peter Karkov : Well, time of course, is a thing. I don't have to prepare my own lunch and think about what I have to eat. It's just there. And then I also get a more variated cost than I would if I made it myself. It would just be something with bread or something. A quick sandwich or something I had yesterday.\n[00:06:30 - 00:06:31] Astrid : Right.\n[00:06:31 - 00:06:38] Peter Karkov : So it's time. And hopefully healthy. Yeah. Diet I get here.\n[00:06:38 - 00:06:39] Nicole : Nice.\n[00:06:40 - 00:06:50] Astrid : So if you were to design this lunch scheme yourself, is there anything you would change? Anything you would have liked more of? Some changes you would like to see?\n[00:06:50 - 00:06:59] Peter Karkov : I would make it more varied in the. What's called the selection of food, but of course that would be more expensive.\n[00:06:59 - 00:07:03] Astrid : So is there anything in particular you would like more of?\n[00:07:05 - 00:07:06] Peter Karkov : I don't know.\n[00:07:06 - 00:07:11] Astrid : No, no, just more things.\n[00:07:11 - 00:07:27] Peter Karkov : Yeah, just more varied. The vegetarian dishes are usually very boring. They make something. I don't think it's made from a vegetarian, so they don't know what people want. So it's usually something really dull.\n[00:07:27 - 00:07:31] Astrid : Yeah. Not exciting. Some more vegetarian variety as well?\n[00:07:31 - 00:07:32] Peter Karkov : Yeah.\n[00:07:33 - 00:07:34] Nicole : Are you vegetarian?\n[00:07:34 - 00:07:43] Peter Karkov : No, but my girlfriend is. So I eat a lot of vegetarian. Vegetarian at home and make delicious meals, but somehow they can't do it here.\n[00:07:44 - 00:07:45] Astrid : Interesting.\n[00:07:45 - 00:07:45] Peter Karkov : Yeah.\n[00:07:47 - 00:07:54] Astrid : And this. These opinions, this feedback. Would you ever want to give that to the municipality who decides?\n[00:07:54 - 00:07:56] Peter Karkov : Yeah, yeah, we have given it.\n[00:07:56 - 00:07:58] Astrid : You have? Okay. How do you do that?\n[00:07:59 - 00:08:12] Peter Karkov : You just write to the canteen lady if you have anything you want to suggestions, anything. She says she will take it to the. What's it called? The contractor who delivers the food.\n[00:08:14 - 00:08:15] Astrid : And that's by email?\n[00:08:16 - 00:08:16] Peter Karkov : Yeah.\n[00:08:17 - 00:08:20] Astrid : Do you feel like your feedback has been heard?\n[00:08:21 - 00:08:32] Peter Karkov : No, but maybe it's because of the economy. If we want more varied food, we have to pay more. And it's not everybody who wants that, I guess.\n[00:08:32 - 00:08:34] Astrid : What do you think about the price?\n[00:08:34 - 00:08:51] Peter Karkov : I think it's fair. We only pay 30 crowns per lunch for the buffet and then the municipality pays also 30 crowns that we don't see. So we only pay 30 crowns out of the 60 crowns. So that's pretty cheap.\n[00:08:51 - 00:08:53] Astrid : Yeah, true.\n[00:08:53 - 00:08:56] Nicole : And if the price were to go up, how would you feel about that?\n[00:08:56 - 00:08:59] Peter Karkov : I would be fine. I would still take it.\n[00:08:59 - 00:09:01] Astrid : What would be the highest price?\n[00:09:02 - 00:09:03] Peter Karkov : 50.\n[00:09:04 - 00:09:06] Astrid : And then what would you expect for that?\n[00:09:06 - 00:09:21] Peter Karkov : Then I would really expect diverse assortment of different dishes or just more to choose from, and the quality would hopefully be higher.\n[00:09:21 - 00:09:21] Astrid : Yeah.\n[00:09:45 - 00:09:46] Peter Karkov : Oh, sorry.\n[00:09:46 - 00:09:47] Nicole : No, go ahead.\n[00:09:49 - 00:09:50] Astrid : Yeah, true.\n[00:09:50 - 00:09:52] Nicole : It's okay. We're almost at the end anyway. Yeah, I just.\n[00:09:52 - 00:10:11] Astrid : I had one question. How would you describe the food now? If you were to describe, kind of like, generalize on the food that you get now? So, I mean, is it, like, a bit traditional or is it, like, innovative, or. Do you know where I'm going?\n[00:10:11 - 00:10:13] Peter Karkov : Yeah, I think it's traditional.\n[00:10:14 - 00:10:14] Astrid : Okay.\n[00:10:15 - 00:10:19] Peter Karkov : Yeah. And medium, standard traditional.\n[00:10:19 - 00:10:20] Nicole : Nice.\n[00:10:20 - 00:10:23] Astrid : Do you have any sense of what your colleagues think about it?\n[00:10:24 - 00:10:28] Peter Karkov : Yeah, they don't like the quality. No.\n[00:10:28 - 00:10:29] Astrid : Okay. Interesting.\n[00:10:30 - 00:10:31] Peter Karkov : Yeah.\n[00:10:31 - 00:10:35] Astrid : Cool. Is there anything else you would like to say about the lunch theme?\n[00:10:36 - 00:10:38] Peter Karkov : No, I don't think so. I think you got it all.\n[00:10:39 - 00:10:39] Astrid : Yeah.\n[00:10:39 - 00:10:40] Peter Karkov : Yeah.\n[00:10:40 - 00:10:41] Nicole : Perfect. Great. Very helpful.\n[00:10:41 - 00:10:42] Astrid : Thank you so much.\n[00:10:42 - 00:10:43] Peter Karkov : You're welcome.\n[00:10:43 - 00:10:44] Astrid : Thank you for doing your work.\n"}, {"PROJECT": "CO-066", "YEAR": 2024, "MONTH": "August", "NAME": "DIEGO MIEL \u0301S", "DESCRIPTION": "It's dedicated to the extraction, processing and marketing of honey and its derivatives: pollen, royal jelly and propolis honey.", "COUNTRY": "Colombia", "GEOGRAPHY": "Colombia", "FILE": "3.

So if you start bringing them food, they'll start to rely on it very quickly. And they would. Yeah, they could be tamed and become pets very easily. So we have to sort of hold that off a bit. But on the other hand, we need to be able to catch them. And we've got some bagots. They're a rare breed. They're very good. They're a lot more hardy. They can be kept outside with no shelters, but they are very flighty and they've got that wild heritage in them still. So they're difficult on the management side in terms of people, but they're very good at doing what they. What they do.\n[00:00:55 - 00:01:01] Eoghan : I guess that's all. You always got to be thinking about that with them, just because you also have to send them off to slaughter.\n[00:01:03 - 00:01:55] Carol : What's difficult is the. The milking goats because when you've. You sat beside them, warmed your hands on their fur and they're. They're nourished by their milk and then, you know, so you have to. I find I have to keep that in my head all the time because I couldn't make that decision on each one. So that's what we do and that's what was agreed in the project at the beginning. That's what we do. And there's a bit in our milkers agreement where we say that even the retired milkers will go for meat. They don't get to live out in green, lush fields the rest of their lives because again, that's part of being sustainable and not overusing resources unnecessarily. Yeah, better to have a short, good life than, you know, if they get old and end up in pain and need get ill and stuff.\n"}, {"PROJECT": "NZ-002", "YEAR": 2024, "MONTH": "September", "NAME": "TE KAKANO", "DESCRIPTION": "Te K\u0101kano Aotearoa Trust is a W\u0101naka non-profit organisation that eco-sources seeds from the Upper Clutha area, raises seedlings in an extensive nursery, and facilitates community-based native planting and habitat restoration.

Hello, welcome. We are here for Taikakano project and we have two beautiful people to present us the project. So we just wanted to learn, like what do you do and what is it Tekacono about?\n[00:00:16 - 00:00:40] Loran Verpillot : Takano is a charitable trust and we are here in a community native plant nursery and we grow native plants and we plant them with the community. So we really about connecting the community with the land and we also do habitat restoration here in Aotear, New Zealand.\n[00:00:42 - 00:00:46] Matej : Okay, who do this project? Like who does this project?\n[00:00:46 - 00:00:47] Nik Woolford : Who?\n[00:00:47 - 00:00:49] Matej : It's the people behind the project.\n[00:00:52 - 00:01:58] Nik Woolford : So the project was started about 16 years ago by a local person who looked around and thought, this is quite barren. We can restore the habitat and the ecosystems that used to be here. And how about getting people's hands in the dirt and connecting them at the same time with their own local environment? So that's how we started. We collect seed locally, we sow those seeds and plant them around about three years later, the resultant plants into the same sort of area. They're all plants and species that are local to the area, that have the adaptions and the genetics of this area. New Zealand is pretty special in what we've got here here. And so we're wanting to protect that. If we plant plants that are part of the ecosystem, we find that the fauna follows as well. So we're actually about restoring ecosystems, the full ecosystems and who.\n[00:01:59 - 00:02:23] Loran Verpillot : Who the plants first and the people. And mostly it's volunteers doing the work. There's a board of trustees, they are volunteers, but they lead the trust. And then there's five contractors and hundreds of volunteers doing all the hard work, including growing these beautiful plants and planting them in the wild.\n[00:02:25 - 00:02:39] Matej : Yeah, and how you are doing this project, how you're planting. So basically you go outside and you plan by yourselves. Right, that's your. Like the volunteers are working for you. So that's how you do it. Go outside and do it.\n[00:02:39 - 00:03:03] Loran Verpillot : Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we work with. Sorry, we work with the council and the Department of Conservation. So we plan on public land only so everyone can enjoy the work we do. We plant a lot along walking and biking track tracks in the area and. Yeah, so we work together to find the right spots and the right species for the right area.\n[00:03:05 - 00:03:48] Nik Woolford : So all throughout the year, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, we have work that happens here in the nursery itself. Volunteers come along and help with that. Well do most of that work. And then our planting season when we're planting out into the land is from late autumn, which is May for us all through Winter and into early spring, which takes us to about September, October. And we plant every second Saturday on a. At a different site in and around Wanaka. Small sites and generally up to 200 plants each time. Yes.\n[00:03:48 - 00:03:56] Matej : And how do you feel like New Zealand is specific for? Like, what is specific about New Zealand?\n[00:03:56 - 00:04:30] Nik Woolford : New Zealand is so special. We are so special. We are out of the box both with our flora and our fauna. Actually even more so with our fauna. But certainly our flora been isolated from other countries, broke away from Gondwana land around about 50 million years ago. And so since then, through various climate changes, plants and animals have adapted to that. The only mammal that we ever had in New Zealand was. Were bats, but the rest is just birds.\n[00:04:31 - 00:04:34] Loran Verpillot : And the seals were kind of around the seals.\n[00:04:34 - 00:05:40] Nik Woolford : Yeah, true. This is terrestrial. Yeah, yeah. And so our plants and animals adapted to that kind of ecosystem where. Or ecosystems where. Yeah, there weren't any mammals. Some birds filled that niche of being predators, but whole other set of adaptations, you know, for an avian dominated ecosystem or ecosystems across New Zealand. And so our flora reflects a lot of that. This one, I'm dying to talk about plants. This is a kopai, which is Maori word for yellow. It has yellow flowers and yellow seeds. And a lot of species in New Zealand are unique in the world in that within their life cycle they have different forms. This is. And many of our plants have this, what's called a divaricating form, which is very sticky, kind of hard to get your beak into. This one as well.\n[00:05:41 - 00:05:46] Loran Verpillot : Is it 80% of the plants that are endemic to New Zealand that are what? Endemic?\n[00:05:46 - 00:05:48] Nik Woolford : Endemic, yes, yeah, actually, yes.\n[00:05:49 - 00:05:50] Loran Verpillot : Which is really.\n[00:05:51 - 00:06:22] Nik Woolford : It's a big number endemic, you know, to New Zealand, as in only found here. These plants in this area have this kind of habit where to a certain point they will have one form of one life, one shape. And when they get to a certain maturity, they will change sometimes really dramatically into another shape. And that is very unique. Yeah, to New Zealand.\n[00:06:23 - 00:06:30] Matej : So basically trying to rehabilitate the nature from how it was before.\n[00:06:30 - 00:07:14] Nik Woolford : Yeah, yeah. So the reason why we're doing this is to preserve that genetics and the adaptions that these plants have made within this area of New Zealand. New Zealand spans a lot of latitudes and we are the most inland we can be here in New Zealand. In this particular region, the Central Otago region, because of that, there's quite a bit of variety between species. Even within the same species, A particular one that grows here will be quite different than a wetter, warmer environment. And yet it's the same species and the corresponding animals that have grown up with those will be specific to those areas as areas as well. So where was I going with that?\n[00:07:15 - 00:07:41] Loran Verpillot : Another reason why we do what we do is to connect the people with the land. Yeah. It's really crucial to the trust to have that connection between the people and the plants and the animals around us and to get. Get people out planting or get their hands in the dirt so they have that connection and hopefully they will understand their surrounding and care for the environment. Yeah.\n[00:07:41 - 00:07:45] Matej : It's crucial to come here actually, that they can't film anywhere else in the.\n[00:07:45 - 00:07:56] Nik Woolford : World and protect it. You know, it's under threat from all sides still. And it's. If they're connected with it, they realize how special it is, they will help to protect it.\n[00:07:56 - 00:08:11] Loran Verpillot : A lot of the plants we grow and plant are endangered or at risk of becoming endangered. So it's also our work to keep these plants going and thriving and continue to be here. Otherwise they're just going to disappear.\n[00:08:13 - 00:08:37] Nik Woolford : Yeah. There are some certain plants, like these podocarps that need certain animals, birds to be able to ingest the seed, to spread them naturally. Otherwise, you know, as humans doing it is really inefficient. Nature is way more efficient at doing what we are in our small little worlds trying to do. Yeah. So it's just providing that opportunity for us.\n[00:08:37 - 00:08:44] Matej : We'll just keep planting and come and help. Okay.\n[00:08:44 - 00:08:44] Nik Woolford : Yeah.\n[00:08:44 - 00:08:48] Matej : Thank you very much. Like summarize what we have been talking about.\n[00:08:48 - 00:08:51] Nik Woolford : That's pretty cool enough. Yeah.\n[00:08:51 - 00:08:53] Matej : If you want to talk more.\n[00:08:53 - 00:08:57] Loran Verpillot : I don't know, what do you want to say?\n[00:08:58 - 00:09:05] Matej : Influence, impact or challenge or achievements? Anything.\n[00:09:06 - 00:09:48] Loran Verpillot : I think for me, really, what's amazing with Takano is the amount of people who get involved, really. And the amount of hours volunteers donate to doing this. Coming to the nursery, growing the plants, weeding them and then looking after them. And then the amount of hours people spend planting them and watering them. And there's a whole lot of volunteers in our trustees who spend hours doing all the boring things like health and safety and policy writing, which is necessary. But you know, like the passion that brings Tikaakano and the people together is just so heartwarming. Yeah, it's pretty amazing.\n[00:09:48 - 00:10:22] Nik Woolford : And with other, I mean other volunteer groups will know this as well. We're set up to do. You know, we have a few different streams to our vision, but there's a lot of flow on from that with people connecting with nature for health and well being. It's incredible. People come here, it's like their church and without getting religious because I'm not. But you know, yeah, they, they really enjoy that. It's a whole other community and also.\n[00:10:23 - 00:10:59] Loran Verpillot : We have the program for schools and young people and having preschoolers come here and looking at the plants and touching them and talking about them. It's just so unique and fantastic. Like you could see them because they live with a tiny plant to look after throughout the hole year at the preschool before they go to primary school. And they live with a tiny kanuka whatever plant and they're so proud and they're so happy and they get. They're gonna look after. Hopefully they're going to look after the plant and then plant it. But just bringing that joy through a plant is.\n[00:10:59 - 00:11:32] Nik Woolford : Do you mean the ivy's coming? She said came in? Well, we have a bit of a program where we lead them through the enchanted forest which is the Kanuka forest behind us, find the secret gate which is a little gate in the fence to them to climb through. And then they're here at this nursery and we showed her. Ivy was 4 years old and a group of others and she said, this has been the best time ever. I'm going to be dream. I'll dream about this forever. And it's like the teacher said, I didn't script that. That wasn't, you know, it was just her doing it. It was awesome.\n[00:11:35 - 00:11:37] Loran Verpillot : Yeah. So Precious. Yeah.\n[00:11:37 - 00:11:40] Nik Woolford : Little ID. She's probably 15. No, she's not.\n[00:11:40 - 00:11:42] Loran Verpillot : No, she's six now.\n[00:11:42 - 00:11:44] Matej : Coming and worshiping the plants.\n[00:11:44 - 00:12:17] Loran Verpillot : Yeah. Yeah. And it all comes down to, you know, touching it and learning a fun fact about it or, you know, liking the tiny flower that you need to look. Look at with a magnifying glass or, you know, it's just all these tiny things that we can do that you can't really do in a classroom but you can do here because that's what we love doing and that's what we do. We do hands on participation. We do practical things where people get the hand with the seeds and touch them and smell them and yeah, it creates a unique experience that hopefully they won't forget.\n[00:12:17 - 00:12:39] Nik Woolford : And sometimes too with a group that might come, you know, a class that might come. It's the kids on the outside that you can see that. Oh, in the classroom setting they're a bit of a challenge. They come here and they find their own spot and it's really cool. And the teachers are quite supportive, surprised. They were well engaged and they were into it, you know, and yeah, they found something that's really rewarding as well. Yeah.\n[00:11:44 - 00:12:16] Loran Verpillot : Yeah, yeah. And it all comes down to, you know, touching it and learning a fun fact about it or, you know, liking the tiny flower that you need to look.
